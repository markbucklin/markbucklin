A potential solution to these problems is to enable scientists to build their own high-performance and adaptable system by overcoming a resource insufficiency. Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope that can be used for in

The dedicated design enabled imaging depths close to 1 mm into mouse brain tissue and a signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded all commercial two-photon systems tested. In addition to a detailed parts list, instructions for assembly, testing and troubleshooting, our plan includes complete three dimensional computer models that greatly reduce the knowledge base required for the non-expert user. This open-source resource lowers barriers in order to equip more laboratories with high-performance two-photon imaging and to help progress our understanding of the cellular and physiological function of living systems.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate hydroxyapatite paste (BoneSource; Leibinger Corp., Dallas, TX) as an alloplastic implant for supraorbital and malar augmentation. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats had cylindrical onlay implants made of the hydroxyapatite cement placed above their left orbits on the supraorbital rim. Size-matched Medpor implants were placed similarly on the right side. To test the utility of this new material in the midface, hydroxyapatite paste and Medpor implants were also placed in the right malar regions of a different set of rats. The implants were left in situ for 6 months and examined for evidence of bone ingrowth, infection, migration, resorption, and detrimental effects on the surrounding tissue. All hydroxyapatite cement implants provided excellent soft tissue projection and demonstrated steadfast adherence to the adjacent bone. The surface of the hydroxyapatite implant in contact with the native bone demonstrated evidence of native bony ingrowth into approximately 12\% of the implant. There was no evidence of implant migration or gross infection. There was no bony resorption below the hydroxyapatite paste, but four of the Medpor implants showed evidence of this in the underlying bone. Only one negative aspect to the use of hydroxyapatite cement paste as an onlay implant was identified. Two of the supraorbital and one of the malar hydroxyapatite implants had approximately 20 to 25\% volume loss during the experimental period (P = 0.05). Overall, the vast majority of the implants retained their original form. We concluded that hydroxyapatite paste may possibly be used to effectively augment bone in the supraorbital and malar regions. Its biocompatibility, excellent bony adherence, and tendency to be replaced by natural bone may make it suitable for the aesthetic patient. The possible resorptive aspects of the material need to be evaluated further.},

  doi = {10.1179/1743132814Y.0000000429},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are a common concern in skull base surgery. Appropriate dural healing is crucial to prevent CSF leaks but the entire process has been barely understood so far. Here, we review the impact of growth factors and chemotherapeutic agents on an explant culture of human dural fibroblasts and a 3D subculture grown in a collagen mesh scaffold.
METHODS: Human dural specimens were harvested during surgical procedures where they would not be further used therapeutically or diagnostically. Explant cultures were grown in Petri dishes, and subcultures were grown in collagen mesh scaffolds. Insulin, fibroblast growth factor type 2 (FGF-2), and human serum were analyzed for their effect as growth factors, whereas mitomycin C, vincristine, and colchicine were analyzed for their role as inhibitors. Cell count was used as a parameter to assess the effects of these factors. In addition, the effects of human serum were assessed using collagen mesh scaffolds.
RESULTS: Insulin, FGF-2, and human serum increased culture cell count; human serum also achieved an increased number of viable fibroblasts embedded in a collagen mesh. Mitomycin C, which is a mitosis inhibitor, showed no significant effect on cell count, whereas colchicine and vincristine, which inhibit both mitosis and migration, resulted in cell growth suppression.
DISCUSSION: In our model, dural defect closure is achieved through cell migration rather than through cell growth. Adding growth factors to the dural suture line or into a collagen mesh might prove useful to stimulate dural closure.},

  abstract = {Neurophysiological recording in alert monkeys requires the creation of a permanent aperture in the skull for repeated insertion of microelectrodes. Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

  abstract = {An important issue for neurophysiological studies of the visual system is the definition of the region of the visual field that can modify a neuron's activity (i.e., the neuron's receptive field \textendash{} RF). Usually a trade-off exists between precision and the time required to map a RF. Manual methods (qualitative) are fast but impose a variable degree of imprecision, while quantitative methods are more precise but usually require more time. We describe a rapid quantitative method for mapping visual RFs that is derived from computerized tomography and named back-projection. This method finds the intersection of responsive regions of the visual field based on spike density functions that are generated over time in response to long bars moving in different directions. An algorithm corrects the response profiles for latencies and allows for the conversion of the time domain into a 2D-space domain. The final product is an RF map that shows the distribution of the neuronal activity in visual\textendash{}spatial coordinates. In addition to mapping the RF, this method also provides functional properties, such as latency, orientation and direction preference indexes. This method exhibits the following beneficial properties: (a) speed; (b) ease of implementation; (c) precise RF localization; (d) sensitivity (this method can map RFs based on few responses); (e) reliability (this method provides consistent information about RF shapes and sizes, which will allow for comparative studies); (f) comprehensiveness (this method can scan for RFs over an extensive area of the visual field); (g) informativeness (it provides functional quantitative data about the RF); and (h) usefulness (this method can map RFs in regions without direct retinal inputs, such as the cortical representations of the optic disc and of retinal lesions, which should allow for studies of functional connectivity, reorganization and neural plasticity). Furthermore, our method allows for precise mapping of RFs in a 30$^\circ$ by 30$^\circ$ area of the visual field for an array of microelectrodes of any size in less than 6 min.},

The method consists of a hydrodynamically confined flow of the active chemical compound, which locally stimulates neurons in brain slices, applied in conjunction with electrophysiological recording techniques to analyze the response. The microfluidic device, which is a novel free-standing multifunctional pipette, allows diverse superfusion experiments, such as testing the effects of different concentrations of drugs or drug candidates on neurons in different cell layers with high positional accuracy, affecting only a small number of cells. We demonstrate herein the use of the method with electrophysiological recordings of pyramidal cells in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex brain slices from rats, determine the dependence of electric responses on the distance of the superfusion device from the recording site, document a multifold gain in solution exchange time as compared to whole slice perfusion, and show that the device is able to store and deliver up to four solutions in a series. Localized solution delivery by means of open-volume microfluidic technology also reduces reagent consumption and tissue culture expenses significantly, while allowing more data to be collected from a single tissue slice, thus reducing the number of laboratory animals to be sacrificed for a study.},

  abstract = {Background
Statistical inference of signals is key to understand fundamental processes in the neurosciences. It is essential to distinguish true from random effects. To this end, statistical concepts of confidence intervals, significance levels and hypothesis tests are employed. Bootstrap-based approaches complement the analytical approaches, replacing the latter whenever these are not possible.
New method
Block-bootstrap was introduced as an adaption of the ordinary bootstrap for serially correlated data. For block-bootstrap, the signals are cut into independent blocks, yielding independent samples. The key parameter for block-bootstrapping is the block length. In the presence of noise, na\"ive approaches to block-bootstrapping fail. Here, we present an approach based on block-bootstrapping which can cope even with high noise levels. This method naturally leads to an algorithm of block-bootstrapping that is immediately applicable to observed signals.
Results
While na\"ive block-bootstrapping easily results in a misestimation of the block length, and therefore in an over-estimation of the confidence bounds by 50\%, our new approach provides an optimal determination of these, still keeping the coverage correct.
Comparison with existing methods
In several applications bootstrapping replaces analytical statistics. Block-bootstrapping is applied to serially correlated signals. Noise, ubiquitous in the neurosciences, is typically neglected. Our new approach not only explicitly includes the presence of (observational) noise in the statistics but also outperforms conventional methods and reduces the number of false-positive conclusions.
Conclusions
The presence of noise has impacts on statistical inference. Our ready-to-apply method enables a rigorous statistical assessment based on block-bootstrapping for noisy serially correlated data.},

  abstract = {The presence of fixative-induced and cellular-derived artifactual autofluorescences (AAFs) presents a challenge in histological analysis involving immunofluorescence. We have established a simple and highly effective method for the reduction of AAFs that are ubiquitous in fixed mammalian brain and other tissues. A compact AAF-quenching photo-irradiation device was constructed using a commercially available light emitting diode (LED) array, cooling unit, and supporting components. The LED panel is comprised of an array of multispectral high intensity LEDs which serve as the illumination source for the photo-irradiation process. Rabbit and cat brain specimens of 5 $\mu$m- and 40 $\mu$m-thicknesses, respectively, were photo-irradiated for various durations. The AAFs were reduced to near tissue background levels after 24 h of treatment for both deparaffinized and paraffinized rabbit brain specimens, and for the free-floating cat brain specimens. Subsequent immunofluorescence staining using primary antibodies against GFAP, NeuN, Iba-1, and MAP-2, and the corresponding Qdot\textregistered{} and Alexafluor\textregistered{} fluoroconjugates confirmed that the LED photo-irradiation treatment did not compromise the efficiency of the immunofluorescence labeling. The use of the device is not labor intensive, and only requires minimal tissue processing and experimental set-up time, with very low maintenance and operating costs. Finally, multiple specimens, in both slide and well-plate format, can be simultaneously photo-irradiated, thus, allowing for scalable batch processing.},

  abstract = {Summary
Cranioplasty is a procedure commonly performed by plastic surgeons involved in craniofacial surgery, in which it is generally accepted that the ideal reconstructive material is autogenous bone. When this is not available or when its use is inappropriate, alloplastic materials are the next best option. A retrospective analysis was carried out to review the senior author's experience of 98 cranioplasties with methylmethacrylate (MM) from 1980 to 2001. The site and size of the implant and complications thereof were recorded and an assessment of the quality of the final result made.

The patients were divided into two groups:

Group 1: Methylmethacrylate as a full thickness inlay.

Group 2: Methylmethacrylate as an onlay only.

In group 1 there were 32 patients for whom the average follow up was 8.2 years (range 2\textendash{}16 years). In group 2 there were 66 patients with an average follow up of 7.1 years (range 2\textendash{}20 years). After a minimum follow up of 2 years, 89 out of 98 of the patients retained their implants. Nine implants in total were removed. Of the 89 patients retaining their implants, 85 had excellent or good results at long-term follow up. The infection and implant removal rate was very high if nasal or frontal sinus tissue was in direct contact with the implant during the operative procedure.

The keys to the successful use of methylmethacrylate are discussed and representative case examples are presented. There is increasing evidence that the long term results of newer alternatives to methylmethacrylate for cranioplasty such as hydroxyapatite cement are disappointing and do not justify their expense. Methylmethacrylate is cheap, readily available and easy to use and it remains the alloplastic material of choice for cranioplasty in our hands.},

  abstract = {We have designed a device for long-term head fixation for use in behaving nonhuman primates that is robust yet minimally invasive and simple to use. This device is a modified version of the halo system that is used in humans for cervical traction and stabilization after spinal column injuries. This device consists of an aluminum halo with four titanium skull pins offset from the halo by aluminum posts. The titanium pins insert onto small segments of cranially reinforcing titanium plate, which are attached to the skull with titanium cortex screws. The surgery involves four scalp incisions, placement of the reinforcing plates, insertion of the pins for attachment of the halo, and incision closure. After the halo is attached, the animal's head can be fixed to a primate chair using a custom-built attachment arm that provides three degrees of adjustability for proper positioning during behavioral tasks. We have installed this device on two Macaque monkeys weighing 7 and 10 kg. The halos have been in place on these animals for up to 8 months without signs of discomfort or loss of fixation. Using this method of head fixation, we have been able to track the animals' eye positions with an accuracy of less than two visual degrees while they perform behavioral tasks.},

  abstract = {Investigators that require the chronic implantation of hardware on the non-human primate skull are often challenged with the possible failure of head implants. To improve the success rate of our head implants, titanium anchor screws, referred to as titanium endosseous implants, were implanted in the skulls of six macaques. Techniques adapted from the processing of dentures were utilized to pre-fabricate an acrylic `skull cap', which provided the mechanical support structure for our study-specific hardware. A two-stage procedure adapted from dentistry (Br\aa{}nemark et al., 1977) was employed for the placement of titanium endosseous implants in the skull. This two-stage technique incorporates the principles of osseointegration and a healing period. Of the six skull-anchored implants prepared implementing the methods described in this paper, we have not experienced any failures. Additionally, all of the titanium endosseous implants examined post mortem were functionally successful (n=30). Histology results confirmed that there was healthy bone in direct contact with the titanium endosseous implants. The dense cortical bone of the macaque skull is ideal for the implantation of titanium endosseous implants. Titanium endosseous implants have provided secure, functional anchor points for the attachment of hardware to the macaque skull and have resulted in healthy, stable head implants that can remain on the skull for extended periods of time.},

  abstract = {This study reports extensive characterization of the silicone gel (3-4680, Dow Corning, Midland, MI), for potential use as an artificial dural sealant in long-term electrophysiological experiments in neurophysiology. Dural sealants are important to preserve the integrity of the intracranial space after a craniotomy and in prolonging the lifetime and functionality of implanted brain probes. In this study, we report results of our tests on a commercially available silicone gel with unique properties that make it an ideal dural substitute. The substitute is transparent, elastic, easy to apply, and has re-sealing capabilities, which makes it desirable for applications where multiple penetrations by the brain probe is desirable over an extended period of time. Cytotoxicity tests (for up to 10 days) with fibroblasts and in vivo tests (for 12 weeks) show that the gel is non-toxic and does not produce any significant neuronal degeneration when applied to the rodent cortex even after 12 weeks. In vivo humidity testing showed no sign of CSF leakage for up to 6 weeks. The gel also allows silicon microprobes to penetrate with forces less than 0.5 mN, and a 200-$\mu$m diameter stainless steel microprobe with a blunt tip to penetrate with a force less than 2.5 mN. The force dependency on the velocity of penetration and thickness of the gel was also quantified and empirically modeled. The above results demonstrate that the silicone gel (3-4680) can be a viable dural substitute in long-term electrophysiology of the brain.},

Available modules at present are \textendash{} 1. In-house developed algorithms for: data display (2D and 3D), file operations (file splitting, file concatenation, and file column rearranging), baseline correction, slow stimulus artifact removal, noise characterization and signal quality assessment, current source density (CSD) analysis, latency estimation from LFPs and CSDs, determination of cortical layer activation order using LFPs and CSDs, and single LFP clustering; 2. Existing modules: spike detection, sorting and spike train analysis, and EEG signal analysis. SigMate has the flexibility of analyzing multichannel signals as well as signals from multiple recording sources. The in-house developed tools for LFP analysis have been extensively tested with signals recorded using standard extracellular recording electrode, and planar and implantable multi transistor array (MTA) based neural probes. SigMate will be disseminated shortly to the neuroscience community under the open-source GNU-General Public License.},

The present study validates a method for continuous measurement of the local EP responses during focal cortical infarction induced via photothrombosis. Single microwire electrodes were acutely implanted into the primary auditory cortex of eight rats. Multi-unit neural activity, evoked via a continuous 2 Hz click stimulus, was recorded before, during and after infarction to assess neuronal function in response to local, permanent ischemia. During sham infarction, the average stimulus-evoked peak firing rate over 20 min remained stable at 495.5 $\pm$ 14.5 spikes s \textendash{}1 , indicating temporal stability of neural function under normal conditions. Stimulus-evoked peak firing was reliably reduced to background levels (firing frequency in the absence of stimulus) following initiation of photothrombosis over a period of 439 $\pm$ 92 s. The post-infarction firing patterns exhibited unique temporal degradation of the peak firing rate, suggesting a variable response to ischemic challenge. Despite the inherent complexity of cerebral ischemia secondary to microvascular occlusion, complete loss of EP function consistently occurred 300\textendash{}600 s after photothrombosis. The results suggest that microwire recording during photothrombosis provides a simple and highly efficacious strategy for assessing the electrophysiological dynamics of cortical infarction.},

  abstract = {The present study was aimed at developing a new strategy to design and anchor custom-fitted implants, consisting of a head fixation device and a chronic recording chamber, on the skull of adult macaque monkeys. This was done without the use of dental resin or orthopedic cement, as these modes of fixation exert a detrimental effect on the bone. The implants were made of titanium or tekapeek and anchored to the skull with titanium screws. Two adult macaque monkeys were initially implanted with the head fixation device several months previous to electrophysiological investigation, to allow optimal osseous-integration, including growth of the bone above the implant's footplate. In a second step, the chronic recording chamber was implanted above the brain region of interest. The present study proposes two original approaches for both implants. First, based on a CT scan of the monkey, a plastic replicate of the skull was obtained in the form of a 3D print, used to accurately shape and position the two implants. This would ensure a perfect match with the skull surface. Second, the part of the implants in contact with the bone was coated with hydroxyapatite, presenting chemical similarity to natural bone, thus promoting excellent osseous-integration. The longevity of the implants used here was 4 years for the head fixation device and 1.5 years for the chronic chamber. There were no adverse events and daily care was easy. This is clear evidence that the present implanting strategy was successful and provokes less discomfort to the animals.},

  doi = {10.1152/jn.00405.2011},
  abstract = {Neurophysiological recording in alert monkeys requires the creation of a permanent aperture in the skull for repeated insertion of microelectrodes. Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

  abstract = {Measurement of brain activity in multiple areas simultaneously by minimally invasive methods contributes to the study of neuroscience and development of brain machine interfaces. However, this requires compact wearable instruments that do not inhibit natural movements. Application of optical potentiometry with voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye using an implantable image sensor is also useful. However, the increasing number of leads required for the multiple wired sensors to measure larger domains inhibits natural behavior. For imaging broad areas by numerous sensors without excessive wiring, a web-like sensor that can wrap the brain was developed. Kaleidoscopic potentiometry is possible using the imaging system with concatenated sensors by changing the alignment of the sensors. This paper describes organization of the system, evaluation of the system by a fluorescence imaging, and finally, functional brain fluorescence plurimetry by the sensor. The recorded data in rat somatosensory cortex using the developed multiple-area imaging system compared well with electrophysiology results.},

In this research, a novel implantable imaging system for fluorescence potentiometry was developed using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and its application to the analysis of cultured brain slices and the brain of a living mouse is described. A CMOS image sensor, small enough to be implanted into the brain, with light-emitting diodes and an absorbing filter was developed to enable real-time fluorescence imaging. The sensor, in conjunction with a voltage-sensitive dye, was certainly able to visualize the potential statuses of neurons and obtain physiological responses in both right and left visual cortex simultaneously by using multiple sensors for the first time. This accomplished multiplanar and multipoint measurement provides multidimensional information from different aspects. The light microsensors do not disturb the animal behavior. This implies that the imaging system can combine functional fluorescence imaging in the brain with behavioral experiments in a freely moving animal.},

By using a dedicated CMOS image sensor, we have successfully imaged and measured brain serine protease activity in vivo, in real-time, and for an extended period of time. We have developed a biofluorescence imaging device by packaging the CMOS image sensor which enabled on-chip imaging configuration. In this configuration, no optics are required whereby an excitation filter is applied onto the sensor to replace the filter cube block found in conventional fluorescence microscopes. The fully packaged device measures 350 $\mu$m thick \texttimes{} 2.7 mm wide, consists of an array of 176 \texttimes{} 144 pixels, and is small enough for measurement inside a single hemisphere of the mouse brain, while still providing sufficient imaging resolution. In the experiment, intraperitoneally injected kainic acid induced upregulation of serine protease activity in the brain. These events were captured in real time by imaging and measuring the fluorescence from a fluorogenic substrate that detected this activity. The entire device, which weighs less than 1\% of the body weight of the mouse, holds promise for studying freely moving animals.},

We dissected the conversion of preparatory activity to movement within a structured motor cortex circuit. An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits.},

An independent BCI is a communication system for controlling a device by human intension, e.g., a computer, a wheelchair or a neuroprosthes is, not depending on the brain's normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles, but on detectable signals that represent responsive or intentional brain activities. This paper presents a comparative study of the usage of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the naive Bayes (NB) classifiers on describing both right- and left-hand movement through electroencephalographic signal (EEG) acquisition. For the analysis, we considered the following input features: the energy of the segments of a band pass-filtered signal with the frequency band in sensorimotor rhythms and the components of the spectral energy obtained through the Welch method. We also used the common spatial pattern (CSP) filter, so as to increase the discriminatory activity among movement classes. By using the database generated by this experiment, we obtained hit rates up to 70\%. The results are compatible with previous studies.},

  abstract = {Neural prosthetic interfaces use neural activity related to the planning and perimovement epochs of arm reaching to afford brain-directed control of external devices. Previous research has primarily centered on accurately decoding movement intention from either plan or perimovement activity, but has assumed that temporal boundaries between these epochs are known to the decoding system. In this work, we develop a technique to automatically differentiate between baseline, plan, and perimovement epochs of neural activity. Specifically, we use a generative model of neural activity to capture how neural activity varies between these three epochs. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), in which the latent variable (state) corresponds to the epoch of neural activity, coupled with a state-dependent Poisson firing model. Using an HMM, we demonstrate that the time of transition from baseline to plan epochs, a transition in neural activity that is not accompanied by any external behavior changes, can be detected using a threshold on the a posteriori HMM state probabilities. Following detection of the plan epoch, we show that the intended target of a center-out movement can be detected about as accurately as that by a maximum-likelihood estimator using a window of known plan activity. In addition, we demonstrate that our HMM can detect transitions in neural activity corresponding to targets not found in training data. Thus the HMM technique for automatically detecting transitions between epochs of neural activity enables prosthetic interfaces that can operate autonomously.},

However, parameter adjustment and calibration are a trial-and-error process that requires careful fine-tuning in order to obtain reliable software scores in each context configuration. In this paper, we will pinpoint some caveats regarding the choice of parameters, and give an overview of our own and other researchers' experience with widely used behavioral assessment software. We conclude that, although each researcher should weigh the pros and cons of relying on software vs. manual scoring, we should be aware of possible divergence between both scores, which might be especially relevant when dealing with subtle behavioral effects, like for example in generalization or genetic research.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics has proven to be a revolutionary technology in neuroscience and has advanced continuously over the past decade. However, optical stimulation technologies for in vivo need to be developed to match the advances in genetics and biochemistry that have driven this field. In particular, conventional approaches for in vivo optical illumination have a limitation on the achievable spatio-temporal resolution. Here we utilize a sapphire-based microscale gallium nitride light-emitting diode ($\mu$LED) probe to activate neocortical neurons in vivo. The probes were designed to contain independently controllable multiple $\mu$LEDs, emitting at 450 nm wavelength with an irradiance of up to 2 W/mm2. Monte-Carlo stimulations predicted that optical stimulation using a $\mu$LED can modulate neural activity within a localized region. To validate this prediction, we tested this probe in the mouse neocortex that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and compared the results with optical stimulation through a fiber at the cortical surface. We confirmed that both approaches reliably induced action potentials in cortical neurons and that the $\mu$LED probe evoked strong responses in deep neurons. Due to the possibility to integrate many optical stimulation sites onto a single shank, the $\mu$LED probe is thus a promising approach to control neurons locally in vivo.},

  abstract = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ``bias''). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

We also present examples of their use to investigate the role of spike timing precision, correlations across neurons, and field potential fluctuations in the encoding of sensory information.

  abstract = {Mutual information is a principled non-linear measure of dependence between stochastic variables, which is widely used to study the selectivity of neural responses to external stimuli. Here we define and develop a set of novel statistical independence tests based on mutual information, which quantify the significance of neural selectivity to either single features or to multiple, potentially correlated stimulus features like those often present in naturalistic stimuli. If the values of different features are correlated during stimulus presentation, it is difficult to establish if one feature is genuinely encoded by the response, or if it instead appears to be encoded only as a side effect of its correlation with another genuinely represented feature. Our tests provide a way to disambiguate between these two possibilities. We use realistic simulations of neural responses tuned to one or more correlated stimulus features to investigate how limited sampling bias correction procedures affect the statistical power of such independence tests, and we characterize the regimes in which the distribution of information values under the null hypothesis can be approximated by simple distributions (Chi-square or Gaussian). Finally, we apply these tests to experimental data to determine the significance of tuning of the band limited power (BLP) of the gamma [30\textendash{}100 Hz] frequency range of the primary visual cortical local field potential to multiple correlated features during presentation of naturalistic movies. We show that gamma BLP carries significant, genuine information about orientation, space contrast and time contrast, despite the strong correlations between these features.},

To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker\textemdash{}the neuron's encoding time scale\textemdash{}allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

  abstract = {The rodent whisker-associated thalamic nucleus (VPM) contains a somatotopic map where whisker representation is divided into distinct neuronal sub-populations, called ``barreloids''. Each barreloid projects to its associated cortical barrel column and so forms a gateway for incoming sensory stimuli to the barrel cortex. We aimed to determine how the population of neurons within one barreloid encodes naturalistic whisker motion. In rats, we recorded the extracellular activity of up to nine single neurons within a single barreloid, by implanting silicon probes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the barreloids. We found that play-back of texture-induced whisker motion evoked sparse responses, timed with millisecond precision. At the population level, there was synchronous activity: however, different subsets of neurons were synchronously active at different times. Mutual information between population responses and whisker motion increased near linearly with population size. When normalized to factor out firing rate differences, we found that texture was encoded with greater informational-efficiency than white noise. These results indicate that, within each VPM barreloid, there is a rich and efficient population code for naturalistic whisker motion based on precisely timed, population spike patterns.},

  abstract = {Automatic cell segmentation has various applications in cytometry, and while the nucleus is often very distinct and easy to identify, the cytoplasm provides a lot more challenge. A new combination of image analysis algorithms for segmentation of cells imaged by fluorescence microscopy is presented. The algorithm consists of an image pre\&\#x2010;processing step, a general segmentation and merging step followed by a segmentation quality measurement. The quality measurement consists of a statistical analysis of a number of shape descriptive features. Objects that have features that differ to that of correctly segmented single cells can be further processed by a splitting step. By statistical analysis we therefore get a feedback system for separation of clustered cells. After the segmentation is completed, the quality of the final segmentation is evaluated. By training the algorithm on a representative set of training images, the algorithm is made fully automatic for subsequent images created under similar conditions. Automatic cytoplasm segmentation was tested on CHO\&\#x2010;cells stained with calcein. The fully automatic method showed between 89\&\#x25; and 97\&\#x25; correct segmentation as compared to manual segmentation.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.01.020},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genetically engineered calcium and membrane potential indicators provide the potential to estimate the activation dynamics of individual neurons within larger, mesoscale networks (100s-1000+neurons). However, a fully integrated automated workflow for the analysis and visualization of neural microcircuits from high speed fluorescence imaging data is lacking.
NEW METHOD: Here we introduce FluoroSNNAP, Fluorescence Single Neuron and Network Analysis Package. FluoroSNNAP is an open-source, interactive software developed in MATLAB for automated quantification of numerous biologically relevant features of both the calcium dynamics of single-cells and network activity patterns. FluoroSNNAP integrates and improves upon existing tools for spike detection, synchronization analysis, and inference of functional connectivity, making it most useful to experimentalists with little or no programming knowledge.
RESULTS: We apply FluoroSNNAP to characterize the activity patterns of neuronal microcircuits undergoing developmental maturation in vitro. Separately, we highlight the utility of single-cell analysis for phenotyping a mixed population of neurons expressing a human mutant variant of the microtubule associated protein tau and wild-type tau.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We show the performance of semi-automated cell segmentation using spatiotemporal independent component analysis and significant improvement in detecting calcium transients using a template-based algorithm in comparison to peak-based or wavelet-based detection methods. Our software further enables automated analysis of microcircuits, which is an improvement over existing methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We expect the dissemination of this software will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of neuronal networks, promoting the rapid interrogation of circuits in health and disease.},

  abstract = {The application of fluorescence microscopy in cell biology often generates a huge amount of imaging data. Automated whole cell segmentation of such data enables the detection and analysis of individual cells, where a manual delineation is often time consuming, or practically not feasible. Furthermore, compared to manual analysis, automation normally has a higher degree of reproducibility. CellSegm, the software presented in this work, is a Matlab based command line software toolbox providing an automated whole cell segmentation of images showing surface stained cells, acquired by fluorescence microscopy. It has options for both fully automated and semi-automated cell segmentation. Major algorithmic steps are: (i) smoothing, (ii) Hessian-based ridge enhancement, (iii) marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and (iv) feature-based classfication of cell candidates. Using a wide selection of image recordings and code snippets, we demonstrate that CellSegm has the ability to detect various types of surface stained cells in 3D. After detection and outlining of individual cells, the cell candidates can be subject to software based analysis, specified and programmed by the end-user, or they can be analyzed by other software tools. A segmentation of tissue samples with appropriate characteristics is also shown to be resolvable in CellSegm. The command-line interface of CellSegm facilitates scripting of the separate tools, all implemented in Matlab, offering a high degree of flexibility and tailored workflows for the end-user. The modularity and scripting capabilities of CellSegm enable automated workflows and quantitative analysis of microscopic data, suited for high-throughput image based screening.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis techniques provide a powerful means to rapidly and accurately assess complex morphological and functional interactions between neural cells. Current software-based identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an accuracy of $\geq$95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3) validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3-D context, appropriate for the study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.},

  abstract = {Neural activity manifests itself as complex spatiotemporal activation patterns in cell populations. Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram (OEG) is shown to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these OEG and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is sparse ($<$0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only $\approx$10\% of neurons are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration. Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the amplitude of the OEG, thus optically revealing an input-output function for the local network. We conclude that spontaneous activity in the neocortex is sparse and heterogeneously distributed in space and time across the neuronal population. The dissection of the various signal components in bulk-loaded tissue as demonstrated here will enable further studies of signal flow through cortical networks.},

  abstract = {Summary
Corticothalamic slow oscillations of neuronal activity determine internal brain states. At least in the cortex, the electrical activity is associated with large neuronal Ca2+ transients. Here we implemented an optogenetic approach to explore causal features of the generation of slow oscillation-associated Ca2+ waves in the in~vivo mouse brain. We demonstrate that brief optogenetic stimulation (3\textendash{}20~ms) of a local group of layer 5 cortical neurons is sufficient for the induction of global brain Ca2+ waves. These Ca2+ waves are evoked in an all-or-none manner, exhibit refractoriness during repetitive stimulation, and propagate over long distances. By local optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that evoked Ca2+ waves initially invade the cortex, followed by a secondary recruitment of the thalamus. Together, our results establish that synchronous activity in a small cluster of layer 5 cortical neurons can initiate a global neuronal wave of activity suited for long-range corticothalamic integration.},

  abstract = {Neurons in primary sensory cortex have diverse response properties, whereas higher cortical areas are specialized. Specific connectivity may be important for areal specialization, particularly in the mouse, where neighboring neurons are functionally diverse. To examine whether higher visual areas receive functionally specific input from primary visual cortex (V1), we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses of axons from V1 arborizing in three areas with distinct spatial and temporal frequency preferences. We found that visual preferences of presynaptic boutons in each area were distinct and matched the average preferences of recipient neurons. This specificity could not be explained by organization within V1 and instead was due to both a greater density and greater response amplitude of functionally matched boutons. Projections from a single layer (layer 5) and from secondary visual cortex were also matched to their target areas. Thus, transmission of specific information to downstream targets may be a general feature of cortico-cortical communication.},

  abstract = {Active dendrites provide neurons with powerful processing capabilities. However, little is known about the role of neuronal dendrites in behaviourally related circuit computations. Here we report that a novel global dendritic nonlinearity is involved in the integration of sensory and motor information within layer 5 pyramidal neurons during an active sensing behaviour. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons possess elaborate dendritic arborizations that receive functionally distinct inputs, each targeted to spatially separate regions. At the cellular level, coincident input from these segregated pathways initiates regenerative dendritic electrical events that produce bursts of action potential output and circuits featuring this powerful dendritic nonlinearity can implement computations based on input correlation. To examine this in vivo we recorded dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex using two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing an object-localization task. Large-amplitude, global calcium signals were observed throughout the apical tuft dendrites when active touch occurred at particular object locations or whisker angles. Such global calcium signals are produced by dendritic plateau potentials that require both vibrissal sensory input and primary motor cortex activity. These data provide direct evidence of nonlinear dendritic processing of correlated sensory and motor information in the mammalian neocortex during active sensation.},

  abstract = {The ability of the brain to adapt to environmental demands implies that neurons can change throughout life. The extent to which single neurons actually change remains largely unstudied, however. To evaluate how functional properties of single neurons change over time, we devised a way to perform in vivo time-lapse electrophysiological recordings from the exact same neuron. We monitored the contralateral and ipsilateral sensory-evoked spiking activity of individual L2/3 neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. At the end of the first recording session, we electroporated the neuron with a DNA plasmid to drive GFP expression. Then, 2 wk later, we visually guided a recording electrode in vivo to the GFP-expressing neuron for the second time. We found that contralateral and ipsilateral evoked responses (i.e., probability to respond, latency, and preference), and spontaneous activity of individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons are stable under control conditions, but that this stability could be rapidly disrupted. Contralateral whisker deprivation induced robust changes in sensory-evoked response profiles of single neurons. Our experiments provide a framework for studying the stability and plasticity of single neurons over long time scales using electrophysiology.},

The state-of-the art single-wavelength GECI, GCaMP3, has been deployed in a number of model organisms and can reliably detect three or more action potentials in short bursts in several systems in vivo. Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by severalfold, creating a family of ``GCaMP5'' sensors. We tested GCaMP5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two GCaMP5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as GCaMP3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that GCaMP5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor GCaMP3. GCaMP5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.},

  issn = {1044-1549},
  abstract = {Sarcoidosis is likely to result from exposure of genetically susceptible hosts to environmental agents. Erythrocyte (E) complement receptor 1 (CR1) is a membrane protein mediating the transport of immune complexes (ICs) to phagocytes, and at least three polymorphisms on the CR1 gene are related to erythrocyte surface density of CR1 molecules, in turn related to the rate of IC clearance from circulation. We hypothesized that sarcoidosis could be associated with increased frequency of the CR1 gene alleles coding for reduced CR1/E ratio. We studied 91 sarcoid patients and two control groups: 94 healthy volunteers and 71 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three polymorphic sites of CR1 gene, His1208Arg, intron 27 HindIII/RFLP, and Pro1827Arg, were analyzed. The three polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium. The GG genotype for the Pro1827Arg (C(5507)G) polymorphism was significantly associated with sarcoidosis in comparison to both control groups (odds ratio [OR] = 3.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-6.69 versus healthy control subjects, and OR= 2.82, 95\% CI 1.27-6.39 versus COPD control subjects). The same genotype was particularly associated to disease in females (OR = 7.05; 95\% CI 3.10-16.61 versus healthy control subjects). These findings agree with speculations on the role of CR1 gene as a possible susceptibility factor.},

The model of photothermal effect and classical Pennes bio-heat transfer equation were introduced. Finite element method (FEM), which was realized by Matlab software, was used to calculate the temperature distribution. He-Ne laser (633 nm) was used to simulate the physical therapy in in vivo skin tissue. Under the cylinder coordinates, the three-dimension (3-D) geometry of tissue was reduced to two-dimension (2-D) computation. The results contained the radial, axial and temperature 3-D color plot. Combining the time animation display was possible. By changing the laser and tissue parameters we can get different results. This will be the initial and indispensable work of the non-destructive evaluation of the laser induced injury.},

A commercially available thermocouple microprobe was modified so that it could be screwed firmly into a guide cannula that had been stereotactically implanted in the brain. Because the microprobe remains firmly in place, it is possible to record continuously for several hours from a single animal. Because the microprobe is easily removed, one can also record intermittently from several animals at once. The necessary equipment is relatively inexpensive and the modified microprobe can be sterilized and reused indefinitely. This method has proved especially useful for monitoring brain temperature during and after transient cerebral ischemia, an insult that destroys CNS neurons in a temperature-sensitive fashion.$<$/p$>$},

  title = {Light Dosimetry in Vivo},
  volume = {42},
  issn = {0031-9155},
  abstract = {This paper starts with definitions of radiance, fluence (rate) and other quantities that are important with regard to in vivo light dosimetry. The light distribution in mammalian tissues can be estimated from model calculations using measured optical properties or from direct measurements of fluence rate using a suitable detector. A historical introduction is therefore followed by a brief discussion of tissue optical properties and of calculations using diffusion theory, the P3-approximation or Monte Carlo simulations. In particular the form of the scattering function is considered in relation to the fluence rate close to the tissue boundary, where light is incident. Non-invasive measurements of optical properties yield the absorption coefficient mu a and mu s(1 - g), where mu s is the scattering coefficient and g is the mean cosine of the scattering angle. An important question is whether this combination is sufficient, or whether g itself must be known. It appears that for strongly forward scattering, as in mammalian tissues, rather detailed knowledge of the scattering function is needed to reliably calculate the fluence rate close to the surface. Deeper in the tissue mu s (1 - g) is sufficient. The construction, calibration and use of fibre-optic probes for measurements of fluence rate in tissues or optical phantoms is discussed. At present, minimally invasive absolute fluence (rate) measurements seem to be possible with an accuracy of 10-20\%. Examples are given of in vivo measurements in animal experiments and in humans during clinical treatments. Measurements in mammalian tissues, plant leaves and marine sediments are compared and similarities and differences pointed out. Most in vivo light fluence rate measurements have been concerned with photodynamic therapy (PDT): Optical properties of the same normal tissue may differ between patients. Tumours of the same histological type may even show different optical properties in a single patient. Treatment-induced changes of optical properties may also occur. Scattered light appears to contribute substantially to the light dose. All these phenomena emphasize the importance of in situ light measurements. Another important dosimetric parameter in PDT is the concentration and distribution of the photosensitizer. Apart from in vivo fluorescence monitoring, the photosensitizer part of in vivo PDT dosimetry is still in its infancy.},

  abstract = {Thermal damage in heated bovine myocardial tissue is assessed from measured changes in total reflection and transmission of light. Mathematical expressions, based on random walk analysis of light propagation within tissue slabs, are used to relate the diffuse reflection and transmittance to the absorption coefficient, mu a, and effective scattering coefficient, mu's, for samples of myocardial tissue which were subjected to rapid step changes in temperature. Time-dependent changes in mu's, indicate two processes, one with a fast and temperature-dependent rate the other with a slow and apparently temperature-independent rate. For final temperatures above 56.8 degrees C and for the first 500 s after the temperature change, the optical parameters are well fit by exponential forms that exhibit temperature-dependent time constants as predicted by Arrhenius reaction rate theory of thermal damage. The scattering changes are associated with an apparent activation energy, delta E, of 162 kJ/mole and a frequency constant, A, of 3 x 10(23) s-1. This method provides a means for estimating optical coefficients which are needed to assess laser tissue dosimetry.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the one millisecond time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

  abstract = {Local and superficial near-infrared (NIR) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source\textendash{}detector separations ($<$1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function $\gamma$, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If $\gamma$ is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3\textendash{}1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine $\gamma$, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and $\gamma$ can be measured to within $\mp$0.005 mm-1, $\mp$0.05 mm-1, and $\mp$0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm3 in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter $\gamma$.},

The most intensively studied is 4,16-androstadien-3-one, a chemical which is known to modulate mood and have activational effects in the sympathetic nervous system in a context-dependent manner, but whose action in mate-choice contexts remains largely untested. Here we present evidence that this androgen steroid may modulate women's judgments of men's attractiveness in an ecologically valid context. We tested the effects of androstadienone at a speed-dating event in which men and women interacted in a series of brief dyadic encounters. Men were rated more attractive when assessed by women who had been exposed to androstadienone, an effect that was seen in two out of three studies. The results suggest that androstadienone can influence women's attraction to men, and also that research into the modulatory effects of androstadienone should be made within ecologically valid contexts.},

  abstract = {Many neural disorders are associated with aberrant activity in specific cell types or neural projection pathways embedded within the densely-wired, heterogeneous matter of the brain. An ideal therapy would permit correction of activity just in specific target neurons, while leaving other neurons unaltered. Recently our lab revealed that the naturally-occurring light-activated proteins channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (Halo/NpHR) can, when genetically expressed in neurons, enable them to be safely, precisely, and reversibly activated and silenced by pulses of blue and yellow light, respectively. We here describe the ability to make specific neurons in the brain light-sensitive, using a viral approach. We also reveal the design and construction of a scalable, fully-implantable optical prosthetic capable of delivering light of appropriate intensity and wavelength to targeted neurons at arbitrary 3-D locations within the brain, enabling activation and silencing of specific neuron types at multiple locations. Finally, we demonstrate control of neural activity in the cortex of the non-human primate, a key step in the translation of such technology for human clinical use. Systems for optical targeting of specific neural circuit elements may enable a new generation of high-precision therapies for brain disorders.},

The measurement elements of an optical BCI consist of sets of optical sources and detectors. Our current system utilises sources which comprise of dual wavelength light emitting diodes (LED) at 760nm and 880nm. An optical analysis demonstrated that NIR radiation is a negligible source of heating in this case. LED heat conduction however is a major source of heating, and LEDs, though much safer than laser diodes, have been known to cause burns if improperly used. We describe a procedure by which we measure the heat conduction effect of LEDs. We show that the LED systems used in our current generation BCI produce safe levels of thermal energy and are within published safety levels.},

There was significant (90\%) attenuation of the light intensity for both 488 nm and 633 nm at a distance of 2.5 mm from the intracerebral laser light-emitting source. At greater distances from the light-emitting source that corresponded to areas in the cerebral cortex, there was greater attenuation of light intensity for increasing distance with 488 nm than with 633 nm because of the increased vascularity of the cortical mantle and absorption of 488 nm by hemoglobin. When hematoporphyrin derivative was given intravascularly, there was increased attenuation of 633 nm through the cerebral cortex that was similar to that seen for 488 nm in normals. Direct assessment of light intensity in living tissue, which we have shown is possible in this report, will aid in our understanding and interpretation of the histological changes that occur following photodynamic therapy.},

The system is based on a simple design, consisting of a microdrive, control electronics, software, and a unique type of recording chamber. The microdrive consists of an aluminum frame, a set of eight linear actuators driven by computer-controlled miniature stepping motors, and two printed circuit boards (PCBs) that provide connectivity to the electrodes and the control electronics. The control circuitry is structured around an Atmel RISC-based microcontroller, which sends commands to as many as eight motor control cards, each capable of controlling eight motors. The microcontroller is programmed in C and uses serial communication to interface with a host computer. The graphical user interface for sending commands is written in C and runs on a conventional personal computer. The recording chamber is low in profile, mounts within a circular craniotomy, and incorporates a removable internal sleeve. A replaceable Sylastic membrane can be stretched across the bottom opening of the sleeve to provide a watertight seal between the cranial cavity and the external environment. This greatly reduces the susceptibility to infection, nearly eliminates the need for routine cleaning, and permits repeated introduction of electrodes into the brain at the same sites while maintaining the watertight seal. The system is reliable, easy to use, and has several advantages over other commercially available systems with similar capabilities.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer incidence suggests a lifestyle cause. A lifestyle factor used near the breast is the application of antiperspirants/deodorants accompanied by axillary shaving. A previous study did not support a link with breast cancer. If these habits have a role in breast cancer development, women using antiperspirants/deodorants and shaving their underarms frequently would be expected to have an earlier age of diagnosis than those doing so less often. An earlier age of diagnosis would also be expected in those starting to use deodorants and shaving at an earlier age. This is the first study to investigate the intensity of underarm exposure in a cohort of breast cancer survivors. Four hundred and thirty-seven females diagnosed with breast cancer were surveyed. Once grouped by their frequency of underarm hygiene habits, the mean age of diagnosis was the primary end point. Secondary end points included the overall frequency of these habits, and potential usage group confounding variables were evaluated. All statistical tests were two-sided. Frequency and earlier onset of antiperspirant/deodorant usage with underarm shaving were associated with an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis. Combined habits are likely for this earlier age of diagnosis. In conclusion, underarm shaving with antiperspirant/deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer. It is not clear which of these components are involved. Reviewed literature insinuates absorption of aluminium salts facilitated by dermal barrier disruption. Case-controlled investigations are needed before alternative underarm hygiene habits are suggested.},

It has been suggested recently that underarm cosmetics might be a cause of breast cancer, because these cosmetics contain a variety of chemicals that are applied frequently to an area directly adjacent to the breast. The strongest supporting evidence comes from unexplained clinical observations showing a disproportionately high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, just the local area to which these cosmetics are applied. A biological basis for breast carcinogenesis could result from the ability of the various constituent chemicals to bind to DNA and to promote growth of the damaged cells. Multidisciplinary research is now needed to study the effect of long-term use of the constituent chemicals of underarm cosmetics, because if there proves to be any link between these cosmetics and breast cancer then there might be options for the prevention of breast cancer.

  abstract = {Based on the observation of a high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant adjacent to the usual area of application of deodorants and/or antiperspirants, several scientific teams have advanced the hypothesis of a possible link between antiperspirants and breast cancer. The possibility of the involvement of parabens and aluminium salts, traditional components of a number of cosmetic products, has been advanced by the same teams. In order to ascertain whether this hypothesis could or could not be confirmed, a group of clinical experts in oncology was set up to search and analyse the literature data relating to the problem raised with the aim of answering three predefined questions: 1) does it exist experimental or biological arguments supporting a potential link between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer? 2) Does the use of deodorants/antiperspirants have any effect on the increase in the risk of breast cancer? 3) Could a causal relationship between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer be accepted? The scientific data were searched systematically in the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) using standardised search equations. Fifty-nine studies resulting from the literature search were reviewed and nineteen articles with various methodologies were selected for in-depth analysis. In view of the fact that parabens are generally not present in deodorants/antiperspirants, the reflection group's search related purely to the question of aluminium salts. Among these nineteen articles, many are methodologically unsound, do not answer to the questions posed or deal with the question of parabens and were therefore discarded by the reflection group. The expert group's conclusion coincides with those of the French, European and American health authorities. After analysis of the available literature on the subject, no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis was identified and no validated hypothesis appears likely to open the way to interesting avenues of research.},

In contrast, little is known about our ability to select communicative actions, i.e., actions directly designed to modify the mental state of another agent. We have recently provided novel empirical evidence for a mechanism in which a communicator selects his actions on the basis of a prediction of the communicative intentions that an addressee is most likely to attribute to those actions. The main novelty of those findings was that this prediction of intention recognition is cerebrally implemented within the intention recognition system of the communicator, is modulated by the ambiguity in meaning of the communicative acts, and not by their sensorimotor complexity. The characteristics of this predictive mechanism support the notion that human communicative abilities are distinct from both sensorimotor and linguistic processes.},

FDG PET/CT has several recognised applications in colorectal cancer (CRC) imaging including preoperative evaluation of apparently limited metastatic disease, detection of disease recurrence, clarification of equivocal lesions at initial staging, investigation of unexplained rising tumour markers, and incidental detection of occult primary colonic tumours. With a constantly advancing body of evidence and increasing availability, applications of PET/CT in CRC are likely to emerge in therapy response assessment, radiotherapy planning, use of novel tracers and `one-stop' imaging techniques such as iodinated contrast-enhanced PET/CT. With the use of illustrative clinical examples, this article reviews the utility of FDG PET/CT in the management of CRC, discussing its role and limitations in the multimodality imaging of these patients.},

This ``intermediate'' signal is vascular in nature but its biological origin not been elucidated. In the present study, an animal model of the signal has been created and our human studies expanded to directly investigate the contribution of non-artifactual vascular motion induced by muscle contraction to the biological origin of this signal. Under non-invasive conditions during stimulation of the exposed sciatic nerve of the Sprague-Dawley rat, optical responses are robust. These signals can be abolished both pharmacologically and surgically using methods that eliminate muscle motion while leaving the electrophysiological health of the nerve intact. In human studies, signals that are elicited on stimulation of nerves containing motor axons, both within and outside the predicted imaging volume of the spectrometer, have similar temporal characteristics of those previously observed. Moreover, stimulation of sensory nerves alone does not elicit an optical response. These results strongly suggest that the intermediate signals are derived from stimulus-induced muscle contraction (whether via an innervating nerve or by direct stimulation) causing translational vascular motion within the optically interrogated region.},

  shorttitle = {Quantitative Investigation of the Effect of the Extra-Cerebral Vasculature in Diffuse Optical Imaging},
  abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10\%.},

Thus, time-encoded data can be used to recover depth information while photon exiting point is exploited for lateral localization. This approach was tested against simulations, demonstrating both detection and localization capabilities. Preliminary measurements on inhomogeneous phantoms showed good detection sensibility, even for a low optical perturbation, and localization capabilities, yet with decreasing spatial resolution for increasing depths.

  abstract = {This paper reports the design and the experimental results of a fully integrated, low-noise, low-power standard CMOS preamplifier circuit used to record the extracellular electrophysiological activity of in vitro biological neuronal cultures. Our goal is to use the preamplifier in a fully integrated, multi-channel, bi-directional neuro-electronic interface.
Among others, two main requirements must be addressed when designing such kind of integrated recording systems: noise performance and very low frequency disturbance rejection. These two requirements need to be satisfied together with a small silicon area design, to be able to integrate a large number of recording channels (i.e. up to thousands) onto a single die. A prototype preamplifier circuit has been designed and implemented; in this paper we report the experimental results.
While satisfying the above requirements, our circuit offers state-of-the-art smallest area occupation (0.13 mm2) and consumes 4.5 [mu]W. Sub-threshold-biased lateral pnp transistors, used to implement very high resistance value integrated resistors, have been characterized to determine the resistance spread.
The fabricated prototype, coupled with a commercial Micro-Electrode Array (MEA), has been successfully employed to record the extracellular electrophysiological spontaneous activity, both of muscular cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) and of spinal cord neurons from murines.},

  abstract = {We investigated the use of flavoprotein autofluorescence (FA) as a tool to map long-range neural connections and combined FA with laser-uncaging of glutamate to facilitate rapid long-range mapping in vitro. Using the somatosensory thalamocortical slice, we determined that the spatial resolution of FA is $\geq$100\textendash{}200 $\mu$m and that the sensitivity for detecting thalamocortical synaptic activity approximates that of whole cell recording. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX and AP5 abolished cortical responses to electrical thalamic stimulation. The combination of FA with photostimulation using caged glutamate revealed robust long-distance connectivity patterns that could be readily assessed in slices from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual systems that contained thalamocortical, corticothalamic, or corticocortical connections. We mapped the projection from theventral posterior nucleus of thalamus (VPM) to the primary somatosensory cortex-barrel field and confirmed topography that had been previously described using more laborious methods. We also produced a novel map of the projections from the VPM to the thalamic reticular nucleus, showing precise topography along the dorsoventral axis. Importantly, only about 30 s were needed to generate the connectivity map (six stimulus locations). These data suggest that FA is a sensitive tool for exploring and measuring connectivity and, when coupled with glutamate photostimulation, can rapidly map long-range projections in a single animal.},

  abstract = {Flavoprotein fluorescence in the brain is intimately coupled with neuronal aerobic energy metabolism. If flavoproteins are photobleached, neural activities may be affected owing to dysfunction in aerobic energy metabolism in mitochondria. We tested this possibility in cortical slices from mice, and found that exposure to blue light ([lambda] = 475 nm) derived from a 20 mW diode laser for 50 min suppresses trans-synaptic components of field potentials. This finding formed the basis of a transcranial photo-inactivation technique, that was used to investigate auditory signal transmission between the anterior auditory field (AAF) and the primary auditory cortex (AI) in anesthetized mice. Cortical responses in AAF and AI, elicited by 5 kHz tonal stimuli, were visualized using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. After determining responsive areas in AAF and AI, the auditory cortex was exposed to the blue diode laser via the intact skull, while either AAF or AI was protected with a piece of carbon paper. Although the photo-inactivation of AI had no significant effect on the fluorescence responses in AAF, the photo-inactivation of AAF significantly reduced the fluorescence responses in AI, indicating the presence of auditory signal transmission from AAF to AI.},

  abstract = {A major characteristic of neural networks is the complexity of their organization at various spatial scales, from microscopic local circuits to macroscopic brain-scale areas. Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale coverage (several square millimeters) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50 $\mu$m) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid-deformation-based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

  abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue\textendash{}green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of `optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

  abstract = {We describe a real-time electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface system for triaging imagery presented using rapid serial visual presentation. A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction.},

The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, depression and addiction.

  abstract = {Objective:~ 
  A prevalence of at least 30\% for treatment-resistant depression has prompted the investigation of alternative treatment strategies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising targeted approach involving the bilateral placement of electrodes at specific neuroanatomical sites. Given the invasive and experimental nature of DBS for treatment-resistant depression, it is important to obtain both short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety data. This report represents an extended follow-up of 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression who received DBS to the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 25).Method:~ 
  After an initial 12-month study of DBS, patients were seen annually and at a last follow-up visit to assess depression severity, functional outcomes, and adverse events.Results:~ 
  The average response rates 1, 2, and 3 years after DBS implantation were 62.5\%, 46.2\%, and 75\%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit (range=3\textemdash{}6 years), the average response rate was 64.3\%. Functional impairment in the areas of physical health and social functioning progressively improved up to the last follow-up visit. No significant adverse events were reported during this follow-up, although two patients died by suicide during depressive relapses.Conclusions:~ 
  These data suggest that in the long term, DBS remains a safe and effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Additional trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.Abstract Teaser},

  abstract = {Summary 
Treatment-resistant depression is a severely disabling disorder with no proven treatment options once multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy have failed. Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.},

    A 2-day consensus conference was held to examine scientific and ethical issues in the application of deep brain stimulation for treating mood and behavioral disorders, such as major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome.Objectives~ 
    The primary objectives of the conference were to (1) establish consensus among participants about the design of future clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and (2) develop standards for the protection of human subjects participating in such studies.Results~ 
    Conference participants identified 16 key points for guiding research in this growing field.Conclusions~ 
    The adoption of the described guidelines would help to protect the safety and rights of research subjects who participate in clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and have further potential to benefit other stakeholders in the research process, including clinical researchers and device manufactures. That said, the adoption of the guidelines will require broad and substantial commitment from many of these same stakeholders.},

Yet the lack of a general approach to rapidly construct such networks remains a major challenge for 3D tissue culture. Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.},

As a result, causal roles of cholinergic neurons in circuits have been unclear. We integrated optogenetics, freely moving mammalian behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and slice physiology to probe the cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens by direct excitation or inhibition. Despite representing less than 1\% of local neurons, these cholinergic cells have dominant control roles, exerting powerful modulation of circuit activity. Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.},

Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of `signalling' modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted `receiving' nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.},

This review addresses conscious error perception (``error awareness'') in healthy subjects as well as the relationship between error awareness and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We first discuss the main findings on error awareness in healthy subjects. A brain region, that appears consistently involved in error awareness processes, is the insula, which also provides a link to the clinical conditions reviewed here. Then we focus on a neurological condition whose core element is an impaired awareness for neurological consequences of a disease: anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). The insular cortex has been implicated in both error awareness and AHP, with anterior insular regions being involved in conscious error processing and more posterior areas being related to AHP. In addition to cytoarchitectonic and connectivity data, this reflects a functional and structural gradient within the insula from anterior to posterior. Furthermore, studies dealing with error awareness and lack of insight in a number of psychiatric diseases are reported. Especially in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) the performance monitoring system seems impaired, thus conscious error perception might be altered.},

  abstract = {Synthetic genetic programs are built from circuits that integrate sensors and implement temporal control of gene expression. Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5${'}$ untranslated region (5${'}$-UTR) of the mRNA are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs.},

The target for DBS and the stimulation parameters to be used are unknown. Here, we implanted bilateral electrodes in the vicinity of the fornix, a key element of the memory circuitry, and applied DBS with different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes in an experimental model of dementia. Rats received scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to mimic memory impairment. Rats were then tested in the object location task with the following conditions: (i) with attachment of stimulation cable (off stimulation), and (ii) with DBS at various amplitudes (50~$\mu$A, 100~$\mu$A and 200~$\mu$A), 100~$\mu$s pulse width and 100~Hz or 10~Hz stimulation frequency. DBS reversed the memory impairing effects of scopolamine when compared to sham rats. We found that the fornix is not sensitive to the frequency of stimulation, but rather to current levels. With the most optimal stimulation parameter, we found no side-effects on anxiety levels and general motor activity. These findings identify the fornix as a key region in controlling spatial memory functions. DBS of this region, using tailored stimulation parameters, has the potential to improve memory functions in conditions characterised by memory impairment.},

Results 
Three studies examined the use of DBS for dementia. One study involved fornix DBS for Alzheimer disease (AD), and two studies involved DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, one to treat AD and one to treat Parkinson disease dementia. 
Conclusuions 
Evidence for the use of DBS to treat dementia is preliminary and limited. Fornix and nucleus basalis of Meynert DBS can influence activity in the pathologic neural circuits that underlie AD and Parkinson disease dementia. Further investigation into the potential clinical effects of DBS for dementia is warranted.},

  abstract = {Are there distinctions at the neurophysiological level that correlate with voluntary and involuntary actions? Whereas the wide variety of involuntary behaviors (and here mostly the deviant or pathological ones will be considered) will necessarily be represented at some biophysical level in nervous system activity\textendash{}for after all those cellular activity patterns manifest themselves as behaviors and thus there will be a multiplicity of them\textendash{}there could be some general tendencies to be discerned amongst that assortment. Collecting observations derived from neurophysiological activity associated with several pathological conditions characterized by presenting will-less actions such as Parkinson's disease, seizures, alien hand syndrome and tics, it is proposed that a general neurophysiologic tendency of brain activity that correlates with involuntary actions is higher than normal synchrony in specific brain cell networks, depending upon the behavior in question. Wilful, considered normal behavior, depends on precise coordination of the collective activity in cell ensembles that may be lost, or diminished, when there are tendencies toward more than normal or aberrant synchronization of cellular activity. Hence, rapid fluctuations in synchrony is associated with normal actions and cognition while less variability in brain recordings particularly with regards to synchronization could be a signature of unconscious and deviant behaviors in general.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the 1 ms time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light.  Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus.  We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (\textasciitilde{}900 pA), but with a $>$3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, equating to $>$2x increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber (notably, in the typical optogenetic range of 1-10 mW/mm2).  Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons.  The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT function in the cortex of the rhesus macaque.  Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (\textasciitilde{}100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/sec upon illumination.  A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing.  The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

Smoking and overeating are compulsory habits that are difficult to stop. Several studies have shown involvement of the nucleus accumbens in these and other addictive behaviors. In this case report, we describe a patient who quit smoking and lost weight without any effort, and we review the underlying mechanisms of action.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, nicotine dependence, and obesity.

INTERVENTION

The patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Unintended, effortless, and simultaneous smoking cessation and weight loss were observed.

CONCLUSION

This study supports the idea of compulsivity with common circuitry in the processing of diverse rewards and suggests that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens could be a possible treatment of patients with a dependency not responding to currently available treatments.},

Although the treatment has seen widespread use, its therapeutic mechanism remains paradoxical. The subthalamic nucleus is excitatory, so its stimulation at rates higher than its normal firing rate should worsen the disease by increasing subthalamic excitation of the globus pallidus. The therapeutic effectiveness of DBS is also frequency and intensity sensitive, and the stimulation must be periodic; aperiodic stimulation at the same mean rate is ineffective. These requirements are not adequately explained by existing models, whether based on firing rate changes or on reduced bursting. Here we report modeling studies suggesting that high frequency periodic excitation of the subthalamic nucleus may act by desynchronizing the firing of neurons in the globus pallidus, rather than by changing the firing rate or pattern of individual cells. Globus pallidus neurons are normally desynchronized, but their activity becomes correlated in Parkinson's disease. Periodic stimulation may induce chaotic desynchronization by interacting with the intrinsic oscillatory mechanism of globus pallidus neurons.

The importance of the human sense of smell has by far been underestimated in the past. Humans and other primates have been regarded as primarily [‘]optical animals' with highly developed powers of vision but a relatively undeveloped sense of smell. In recent years this assumption has undergone major revision. Several studies indicate that humans indeed seem to use olfactory communication and are even able to produce and perceive certain pheromones; recent studies have found that pheromones may play an important role in the behavioural and reproduction biology of humans. In this article we review the present evidence of the effect of human pheromones and discuss the role of olfactory cues in human sexual behaviour.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven a powerful treatment for medication refractory movement disorders. Success in this group of patients has allowed preliminary studies of DBS to proceed in severe and medication resistant cases of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome (TS). Pathophysiological and imaging studies along with attempts at lesioning the basal ganglia, have offered clues as to nodes in the circuitry that may be amenable to neuromodulation. DBS in neuropsychiatric illness has offered hope, but at this time rigorous screening by interdisciplinary and ethical teams should be employed when establishing treatment candidacy. A cautious approach to these disorders utilizing institutional review board approved research protocols will hopefully shed light onto patient selection and brain target(s) for each disorder. We need to keep an open mind as we move forward and especially that rational therapy may need to be patient and symptom specific. This review will summarize each disorder (depression, OCD and TS), review pathophysiology (both known and speculated), and update the current observations on DBS in each neuropsychiatric condition.},

  abstract = {Background 
We investigated the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) for treatment refractory depression. 
Methods 
Fifteen patients with chronic, severe, highly refractory depression received open-label DBS at three collaborating clinical sites. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the VC/VS region. Stimulation was titrated to therapeutic benefit and the absence of adverse effects. All patients received continuous stimulation and were followed for a minimum of 6 months to longer than 4 years. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\textemdash{}24 item (HDRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF). 
Results 
Significant improvements in depressive symptoms were observed during DBS treatment. Mean HDRS scores declined from 33.1 at baseline to 17.5 at 6 months and 14.3 at last follow-up. Similar improvements were seen with the MADRS (34.8, 17.9, and 15.7, respectively) and the GAF (43.4, 55.5, and 61.8, respectively). Responder rates with the HDRS were 40\% at 6 months and 53.3\% at last follow-up (MADRS: 46.7\% and 53.3\%, respectively). Remission rates were 20\% at 6 months and 40\% at last follow-up with the HDRS (MADRS: 26.6\% and 33.3\%, respectively). The DBS was well-tolerated in this group. 
Conclusions 
Deep brain stimulation of the VC/VS offers promise for the treatment of refractory major depression.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the 1 ms time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

  abstract = {Accurately detecting hidden clinical or behavioral states from sequential measurements is an emerging topic in neuroscience and medicine, which may dramatically impact neural prosthetics, brain \#x2013;computer interface and drug delivery. For example, early detection of an epileptic seizure from sequential electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements would allow timely administration of anticonvulsant drugs or neurostimulation, thus reducing physical impairment and risks of overtreatment. We develop a Bayesian paradigm for state transition detection that combines optimal control and Markov processes. We define a hidden Markov model of the state evolution and develop a detection policy that minimizes a loss function of both probability of false positives and accuracy (i.e., lag between estimated and actual transition time). Our strategy automatically adapts to each newly acquired measurement based on the state evolution model and the relative loss for false positives and accuracy, thus resulting in a time varying threshold policy. The paradigm was used in two applications: 1) detection of movement onset (behavioral state) from subthalamic single unit recordings in Parkinson's disease patients performing a motor task; 2) early detection of an approaching seizure (clinical state) from multichannel intracranial EEG recordings in rodents treated with pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant. Our paradigm performs significantly better than chance and improves over widely used detection algorithms.},

  abstract = {Learning can be motivated by unanticipated success or unexpected failure. The former encourages us to repeat an action or activity, whereas the latter leads us to find an alternative strategy. Understanding the neural representation of these unexpected events is therefore critical to elucidate learning-related circuits. We examined the activity of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and caudate nucleus of monkeys as they performed a trial-and-error learning task. Unexpected outcomes were widely represented in both structures, and neurons driven by unexpectedly negative outcomes were as frequent as those activated by unexpectedly positive outcomes. Moreover, both positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) were represented primarily by increases in firing rate, unlike the manner in which dopamine neurons have been observed to reflect these values. Interestingly, positive RPEs tended to appear with shorter latency than negative RPEs, perhaps reflecting the mechanism of their generation. Last, in the PFC but not the caudate, trial-by-trial variations in outcome-related activity were linked to the animals' subsequent behavioral decisions. More broadly, the robustness of RPE signaling by these neurons suggests that actor-critic models of reinforcement learning in which the PFC and particularly the caudate are considered primarily to be ``actors'' rather than ``critics,'' should be reconsidered to include a prominent evaluative role for these structures.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for a number of movement disorders. This has prompted investigation of its use for other applications including psychiatric disorders. In recent years, DBS has been introduced for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts or ideas (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in order to relieve these obsessions (compulsions). Abnormal activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus has been implicated in OCD. To this end a number of DBS targets including the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), ventral caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been investigated for the treatment of OCD. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in movement disorders, the mechanism of DBS is not fully understood, especially as it relates to psychiatric disorders. While initially thought to create a functional lesion akin to ablative procedures, it is increasingly clear that DBS may induce clinical benefit through activation of axonal fibers spanning the CSTC circuits, alteration of oscillatory activity within this network, and/or release of critical neurotransmitters. In this article we review how the use of DBS for OCD informs our understanding of both the mechanisms of DBS and the circuitry of OCD. We review the literature on DBS for OCD and discuss potential mechanisms of action at the neuronal level as well as the broader circuit level.},

  abstract = {The ability to optimize behavioural performance when confronted with continuously evolving environmental demands is a key element of human cognition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making, monitoring for conflict between competing responses and predicting task difficulty. Precise mechanisms of dACC function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual dACC neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current dACC activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect, is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the dACC. Our results demonstrate that the dACC provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future behavioural responses. In situations with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses.},

PET showed win- and loss-related activations in the paracingulate cortex, temporal poles, precuneus and hippocampus under active DBS, brain areas that have been implicated in action monitoring and behavioral control.

A mixed-model analysis of 296 work shifts (representing about 5300 lap dances) showed an interaction between cycle phase and hormonal contraception use. Normally cycling participants earned about US\$335 per 5-h shift during estrus, US\$260 per shift during the luteal phase, and US\$185 per shift during menstruation. By contrast, participants using contraceptive pills showed no estrous earnings peak. These results constitute the first direct economic evidence for the existence and importance of estrus in contemporary human females, in a real-world work setting.

In practice, citizens who undertake to operate motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol are considered reckless per se and have no right to obstruct law enforcement in determining their condition. Indeed, refusal of roadside sobriety tests, including the Breathalyzer, may be considered a separate offense. The issuing of Miranda-type warnings by police officers has been ruled on recently in New Jersey. In a superior court appellate decision, State v. Spell, the court outlined the necessary procedures, concluding that, although motorists have no right to refuse testing, police officers have an obligation to issue sufficient warnings before the motorist decides how to proceed. In the Spell matter, the defendant incriminated himself by refusing the testing, even though he was acquitted on the drunk-driving charge.

This generalization holds across professions that might be expected to show greater accuracy. Structured assessment instruments based on observable signs have shown promise but are confounded by the wide variations between casual social drinkers and those that have obtained a high level of tolerance. Among sobriety tests, only NHTSA's Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) have substantial, but seriously flawed, research support. Assessing the sobriety of strangers in the low to moderate BAC ranges without resort to chemical tests remains a daunting task. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We created a genetically encoded, optically controlled pacemaker by expressing halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. Using patterned illumination in a selective plane illumination microscope, we located the pacemaker and simulated tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular blocks, and cardiac arrest. The pacemaker converges to the sinoatrial region during development and comprises fewer than a dozen cells by the time the heart loops. Perturbation of the activity of these cells was entirely reversible, demonstrating the resilience of the endogenous pacemaker. Our studies combine optogenetics and light-sheet microscopy to reveal the emergence of organ function during development.},

Cardiac manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis are relatively infrequent, occurring within weeks after the infectious tick bite (median of 21\^A~days), and resulting at this stage from a direct borrelial infection of the myocardium, as indicated by reports of spirochete isolation from pericardium and myocardium. They may persist or appear in the late, tertiary phase of the illness, being then more likely due to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Lyme carditis typically presents with a fluctuating degree of atrioventricular block that spontaneously resolves in several days. Rarely, myocarditis may occur with or without pericardial involvement, in patients presenting with chest pain, ST depression or T wave inversion, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, and various arrhythmias are reported, as well as pericardial effusion or heart failure. A complete recovery is usually observed, spontaneous or after antibiotherapy. Severe myocarditis or Pericarditis leading to death is exceptional. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is based on the same association of clinical and laboratory features as in Lyme disease without cardiac involvement. But the occurrence of conduction disturbances in healthy young people suggests screening for other criteria of Lyme disease. The management of Lyme carditis does not differ from the treatment of Lyme disease without carditis and is mainly based upon the use of doxycycline or ceftriaxone.},

  abstract = {Drug addiction is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by loss of control over motivated behavior. The need for effective treatments mandates a greater understanding of the causes and identification of new therapeutic targets for drug development. Drugs of abuse subjugate normal reward-related behavior to uncontrollable drug-seeking and -taking. Contributions of brain reward circuitry are being mapped with increasing precision. The role of synaptic plasticity in addiction and underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation of the addicted state are being delineated. Thus we may now consider the role of striatal signal transduction in addiction from a more integrative neurobiological perspective. Drugs of abuse alter dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons of the striatum. Dopamine receptors important for reward serve as principle targets of drugs abuse, which interact with glutamate receptor signaling critical for reward learning. Complex networks of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms underlying these receptors are strongly stimulated by addictive drugs. Through these mechanisms, repeated drug exposure alters functional and structural neuroplasticity, resulting in transition to the addicted biological state and behavioral outcomes that typify addiction. Ca2+ and cAMP represent key second messengers that initiate signaling cascades, which regulate synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity that are dysregulated by drugs of abuse. Increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which protein kinases and phosphatases exert their effects during normal reward learning and the addiction process may lead to novel targets and pharmacotherapeutics with increased efficacy in promoting abstinence and decreased side effects, such as interference with natural reward, for drug addiction.},

The recent development of neural photosensitization tools, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), offers new opportunities for non-invasive, flexible and cell-specific neuronal stimulation. Previously, complex spatiotemporal control of photosensitized neurons has been limited by the lack of appropriate optical devices which can provide 2D stimulation with sufficient irradiance. Here we present a simple and powerful solution that is based on an array of high-power micro light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) that can generate arbitrary optical excitation patterns on a neuronal sample with micrometre and millisecond resolution. We first describe the design and fabrication of the system and characterize its capabilities. We then demonstrate its capacity to elicit precise electrophysiological responses in cultured and slice neurons expressing ChR2.},

  abstract = {Studying brain function and its local circuit dynamics requires neural interfaces that can record and stimulate the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetics, a technique that genetically targets specific neurons to express light-sensitive channel proteins, provides the capability to control central nervous system neuronal activity in mammals with millisecond time precision. This technique enables precise optical stimulation of neurons and simultaneous monitoring of neural response by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We previously demonstrated, in vitro, the dual capability (optical delivery and electrical recording) while testing a novel hybrid device (optrode-MEA), which incorporates a tapered coaxial optical electrode (optrode) and a 100 element microelectrode array (MEA). Here we report a fully chronic implant of a new version of this device in ChR2-expressing rats, and demonstrate its use in freely moving animals over periods up to 8 months. In its present configuration, we show the device delivering optical excitation to a single cortical site while mapping the neural response from the surrounding 30 channels of the 6 \texttimes{} 6 element MEA, thereby enabling recording of optically modulated single-unit and local field potential activity across several millimeters of the neocortical landscape.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics, the ability to use light to activate and silence specific neuron types within neural networks in vivo and in vitro, is revolutionizing neuroscientists' capacity to understand how defined neural circuit elements contribute to normal and pathological brain functions. Typically, awake behaving experiments are conducted by inserting an optical fiber into the brain, tethered to a remote laser, or by utilizing an implanted light-emitting diode (LED), tethered to a remote power source. A fully wireless system would enable chronic or longitudinal experiments where long duration tethering is impractical, and would also support high-throughput experimentation. However, the high power requirements of light sources (LEDs, lasers), especially in the context of the extended illumination periods often desired in experiments, precludes battery-powered approaches from being widely applicable. We have developed a headborne device weighing 2 g capable of wirelessly receiving power using a resonant RF power link and storing the energy in an adaptive supercapacitor circuit, which can algorithmically control one or more headborne LEDs via a microcontroller. The device can deliver approximately 2 W of power to the LEDs in steady state, and 4.3 W in bursts. We also present an optional radio transceiver module (1 g) which, when added to the base headborne device, enables real-time updating of light delivery protocols; dozens of devices can be controlled simultaneously from one computer. We demonstrate use of the technology to wirelessly drive cortical control of movement in mice. These devices may serve as prototypes for clinical ultra-precise neural prosthetics that use light as the modality of biological control.},

Analytical calculations and finite-difference simulations based on diffusion theory are compared with discrete-ordinate, finite-difference transport calculations. The influence of the ratio of absorption and transport scattering coefficient on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation are quantified and different definitions for the diffusion coefficient, D, are discussed. We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium. Based on results for simple homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, we analyse diffusion and transport calculation of light propagation in the human brain. For these simulations we convert density maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to optical-parameter maps ( and ) of the brain. We show that diffusion theory fails to describe accurately light propagation in highly absorbing regions, such as haematoma, and void-like spaces, such as the ventricles and the subarachnoid space.},

To date, no studies have explored the neural correlates associated with increases in cognitive load whilst performing a motor task in patients with freezing. In this experiment, 14 PD patients with and 15 PD patients without freezing of gait underwent 3T fMRI while performing a virtual reality gait task. Directions to walk and stop were presented on the viewing screen as either direct cues or as more cognitively indirect pre-learned cues. Both groups showed a consistent pattern of BOLD response within the Cognitive Control Network during performance of the paradigm. However, a between group comparison revealed that those PD patients with freezing of gait were less able to recruit the bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area, as well as the left subthalamic nucleus when responding to indirect cognitive cues whilst maintaining a motor output. These results suggest that PD patients with freezing of gait are unable to properly recruit specific cortical and subcortical regions within the Cognitive Control Network during the performance of simultaneous motor and cognitive functions.},

We used optogenetics and solid-state optics to systematically drive or inhibit an array of distinct circuit elements in freely moving parkinsonian rodents and found that therapeutic effects within the subthalamic nucleus can be accounted for by direct selective stimulation of afferent axons projecting to this region. In addition to providing insight into DBS mechanisms, these results demonstrate an optical approach for dissection of disease circuitry and define the technological toolbox needed for systematic deconstruction of disease circuits by selectively controlling individual components.},

  abstract = {While modulating neural activity through stimulation is an effective treatment for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, an opportunity for improving neuromodulation therapy remains in automatically adjusting therapy to continuously optimize patient outcomes. Practical issues associated with achieving this include the paucity of human data related to disease states, poorly validated estimators of patient state, and unknown dynamic mappings of optimal stimulation parameters based on estimated states. To overcome these challenges, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation device to collect data and run automated closed-loop algorithms; an external tool to prototype classifier and control-policy algorithms; and real-time telemetry to update the implanted device firmware and monitor its state. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic large animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find biomarkers of the observed states and transfer functions of different stimulation amplitudes. Data showed that moderate levels of stimulation suppress hippocampal beta activity, while high levels of stimulation produce seizure-like after-discharge activity. The biomarker and transfer function observations were mapped into classifier and control-policy algorithms, which were downloaded to the implanted device to continuously titrate stimulation amplitude for the desired network effect. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.},

In particular, because current open-loop DBS strategies based on fixed stimulation settings leave the typical parkinsonian motor fluctuations and rapid symptom variations partly uncontrolled, research has for several years focused on developing novel "closed-loop" or "adaptive" DBS (aDBS) systems. aDBS consists of a simple closed-loop model designed to measure and analyze a control variable reflecting the patient's clinical condition to elaborate new stimulation settings and send them to an "intelligent" implanted stimulator. The major problem in developing an aDBS system is choosing the ideal control variable for feedback. Here we review current evidence on the advantages of neurosignal-controlled aDBS that uses local field potentials (LFPs) as a control variable, and describe the technology already available to create new aDBS systems, and the potential benefits of aDBS for patients with Parkinson's disease.},

The intent is to explore using these biomarkers to drive prosthetic actuators or titrate therapy devices such as a deep-brain neurostimulator. The prototype IC uses 5 muW/channel to resolve signals on the order of 1 muVrms. The four channels on the device provide independent spectral analysis from DC to 1 kHz, with variable bandwidth and power filtering characteristics. The noise floor and flexible spectral processing support a broad range of potential applications including sleep staging, Parkinson's disease, detection of movement intention for neuroprosthesis, and detection of high frequency ldquofast ripplesrdquo for exploring seizure prediction. To fully demonstrate the IC's functionality, we include results from a prototype ldquoclosed-looprdquo neurostimulator implementing adaptive titration of therapy based on measured field potential activity.},

  doi = {10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2158431},
  abstract = {Inductive power transmission is widely used to energize implantable microelectronic devices (IMDs), recharge batteries, and energy harvesters. Power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to the load (PDL) are two key parameters in wireless links, which affect the energy source specifications, heat dissipation, power transmission range, and interference with other devices. To improve the PTE, a 4-coil inductive link has been recently proposed. Through a comprehensive circuit based analysis that can guide a design and optimization scheme, we have shown that despite achieving high PTE at larger coil separations, the 4-coil inductive links fail to achieve a high PDL. Instead, we have proposed a 3-coil inductive power transfer link with comparable PTE over its 4-coil counterpart at large coupling distances, which can also achieve high PDL. We have also devised an iterative design methodology that provides the optimal coil geometries in a 3-coil inductive power transfer link. Design examples of 2-, 3-, and 4-coil inductive links have been presented, and optimized for 13.56 MHz carrier frequency and 12 cm coupling distance, showing PTEs of 15\%, 37\%, and 35\%, respectively. At this distance, the PDL of the proposed 3-coil inductive link is 1.5 and 59 times higher than its equivalent 2- and 4-coil links, respectively. For short coupling distances, however, 2-coil links remain the optimal choice when a high PDL is required, while 4-coil links are preferred when the driver has large output resistance or small power is needed. These results have been verified through simulations and measurements.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

Three rats were chronically implanted with microelectrode arrays in both the motor and visual cortices. The rats were subsequently trained over a period of weeks to modulate their motor cortex ensemble unit activity upon delivery of intra-cortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the visual cortex in order to receive a food reward. Rats were given continuous feedback via visual cortex ICMS during the response periods that was representative of the motor cortex ensemble dynamics. Analysis revealed that the feedback provided the animals with indicators of the behavioral trials. At the hardware level, this preparation provides a tractable test model for improving the technology of closed-loop neural devices.},

In such a system, a feedback signal is used to adjust automatically stimulation parameters and optimize the efficacy of stimulation. We explored the feasibility of recording electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) during DBS for use as a feedback control signal. A novel instrumentation system was developed to suppress the stimulus artifact and amplify the small magnitude, short latency ECAP response during DBS with clinically relevant parameters. In vitro testing demonstrated the capabilities to increase the gain by a factor of 1,000x over a conventional amplifier without saturation, reduce distortion of mock ECAP signals, and make high fidelity recordings of mock ECAPs at latencies of only 0.5 ms following DBS pulses of 50 to 100 $\mu$s duration. Subsequently, the instrumentation was used to make in vivo recordings of ECAPs during thalamic DBS in cats, without contamination by the stimulus artifact. The signal characteristics were similar across three experiments, suggesting common neural activation patterns. The ECAP recordings enabled with this novel instrumentation may provide insight into the type and spatial extent of neural elements activated during DBS, and could serve as feedback control signals for closed-loop systems.},

We use results from a computational model of the Parkinsonian basal ganglia to illustrate general issues relevant to eventual clinical or experimental tests of such an algorithm. Specifically, while the relationship between DBS characteristics and performance is highly complex, global search methods appear able to identify novel and effective waveforms with convergence rates that are acceptably fast to merit further investigation in laboratory or clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of DBS are still unclear, and this lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim thalamus, and the local field potentials (LFPs) generated by the population were used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of DBS amplitude. Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity and tremor (Hua , 1998), (Lenz , 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated LFPs and restore the LFP power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a recursively identified autoregressive model (ARX) of the relationship between stimulation input and LFP output, and showed excellent performances in tracking the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and, differently from open-loop DBS, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The closed-loop controller generated a LFP spectrum that approximated more closely the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum afte- - r a change in the neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility of closed-loop control of DBS amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity present in tremor.},

  abstract = {Author SummaryBrain-machine interfaces establish new communication channels between the brain and the external world with the goal of restoring sensory and motor functions for people with severe paralysis or sensory impairments. Current methodologies are based on decoding the motor intent from the recorded neural activity and transforming the extracted information into motor commands to control external devices as robotic arms. We developed a novel computational approach, based on the concept of programming dynamical behaviors trough the bi-directional sensory-motor interaction between the brain and the connected external device. This approach is based on the emulation of some control features of a biological interface, the spinal cord. The first prototype of our interface controls the state of motion of a simulated point mass in a viscous medium. The position of the point mass is encoded into a stimulus to the somatosensory cortex of an anesthetized rat. The evoked activity of a population of motor cortical neurons is decoded into a force vector applied to the point mass. The parameters of the encoder and of the decoder are set to approximate a desired force field. In the first test of the interface, we obtained a family of trajectories that converged upon a stable attractor.},

This synchrony preferentially occurs over 10\textendash{}30 Hz, the so-called beta band. Correlative evidence has been supplemented by experiments in which direct stimulation of the basal ganglia in the beta band slows movement. Yet questions remain regarding the small scale of the latter effects and whether synchrony is an early or even obligatory feature of parkinsonism. Nevertheless, the principle that abnormally synchronised activity in the beta band can disrupt the function finds a precedent in the syndrome of cortical myoclonus. Here, pathologically synchronised discharges of pyramidal neurons are transmitted to the healthy spinal cord. The result is the synchronous discharge of motor units leading to rhythmic jerking.},

  abstract = {Stereotactic thalamotomy of the thalamic nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) is routinely used for movement disorders. During this procedure, it has been observed that high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation of VIM was able to stop the extrapyramidal tremor. In patients with bilateral tremor of extrapyramidal origin, who were resistant to drug therapy, the therapeutic protocol associated (1) a radiofrequency VIM thalamotomy for the most disabled side, and (2) a continuous VIM stimulation for the other side using stereotactically implanted electrodes, connected to subcutaneous stimulators. VIM thalamotomy relieved the tremor in all operated cases. Side effects were mild and regressive. VIM stimulation strongly decreased the tremor but failed to suppress it as completely as thalamotomy did. This was due in part to the fact that programmable stimulator frequency rate is limited to 130 Hz, while it appeared that the optimal stimulation frequency was 200 Hz. This therapeutic protocol appears to be of interest for patients with bilateral extrapyramidal movement disorders.},

  abstract = {Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently been shown to be effective for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, there are many limitations of the current technology: the large size of current microelectrodes ($\sim$1mm diameter); the lack of monitoring of local brain electrical activity and neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine in Parkinson's disease); the open-loop nature of the stimulation (i.e. not guided by brain electrochemical activity). Reducing the size of the monitoring and stimulating electrodes by orders of magnitude (to the size of neural elements) allows remarkable improvements in both monitoring (spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and sensitivity) and stimulation. Carbon nanofiber nanoelectrode technology offers the possibility of trimodal arrays (monitoring electrical activity, monitoring neurotransmitter levels, precise stimulation). DBS can then be guided by changes in brain electrical activity and/or neurotransmitter levels (i.e. closed-loop DBS). Here, we describe the basic manufacture and electrical characteristics of a prototype nanoelectrode array for DBS, as well as preliminary studies with electroconductive polymers necessary to optimize DBS in vivo. An approach such as the nanoelectrode array described here may offer a generic electrical-neural interface for use in various neural prostheses.},

  shorttitle = {Complications of {{Deep Brain Stimulation}}},
  abstract = {Background 
Since the first deep brain stimulation (DBS) performed for movement disorder more than a decade ago, DBS has become a standard operation for advanced Parkinson's disease. Its indications are expanding to areas of dystonia, psychiatric conditions and refractory epilepsy. Additionally, a new set of DBS-related complications have arisen. Many teams found a slow learning curve from this complication-prone operation. We would like to investigate complications arising from 100 DBS electrode insertions and its prevention. 
Methods 
We performed an audit in all DBS patients for operation-related complications in our centre from 1997 to 2008. Complications were classified into operation-related, hardware-related and stimulation-related. Operation-related complications included intracranial haemorrhages and electrode malposition. Hardware-related complications included fracture of electrodes, electrode migration, infection and erosion. Stimulation-related complications included sensorimotor conditions, psychiatric conditions and life-threatening conditions. 
Results 
From 1997 to the end of 2008, 100 DBS electrodes were inserted in 55 patients for movement disorders, mostly for Parkinson's disease (50 patients). There was one symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage (1\%) and two electrode malpositions (2\%). Meticulous surgical planning, use of microdriver and a reliable electrode anchorage device would minimise this group of complications. There were two electrode fractures, one electrode migration and one pulse-generator infection which contributed to the hardware-related complication rate of 5\%. There was no sensorimotor or life-threatening complications in our group. However, three patients suffered from reversible psychiatric symptoms after DBS. 
Conclusion 
DBS is, on the one hand, an effective surgical treatment for movement disorders. On the other hand, it is a complication-prone operation. A dedicated ``Movement Disorder Team'' consisting of neurologists, neurophysiologists, functional neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists and nursing specialists is essential. Liaison among team members in perioperative periods and postoperative care is the key to avoiding complications and having a successful patient outcome.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation; DBS) has become an established treatment for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), and is in trials for refractory epilepsy, headache, and certain mood disorders. Two main themes will advance DBS significantly in the next five years: closed-loop DBS, that is, feedback from brain electrical activity to direct the stimulation; and computational analysis (CA)\textemdash{}electrophysiological modeling to enhance DBS. Closed-loop DBS is currently in clinical trials for refractory epilepsy. New imaging techniques offer preoperative modeling for DBS surgery, including nerve fiber tracts (diffusion tensor imaging), and imaging of volume of tissue activated by a specific electrode. CA techniques for DBS include mathematical models of the abnormally synchronized electrical activity which underlies epilepsy, movement disorders, and likely many mood disorders as well. By incorporating feedback loops and multiple recording and/or stimulating sites, the abnormally synchronized brain electrical activity can be desynchronized, then ``unlearned'' (``unkindling'' in epilepsy). Characteristics of DBS utilizing CA include low frequency rather than high frequency stimulation; multiple stimulation and/or recording sites; likely 10-fold or more reduction in electrical current needs (much smaller ``pulse generators''); more focused and less disruptive stimulation\textemdash{}fewer unwanted side effects; and potential to ``cure'' certain disorders by resetting abnormal firing patterns back to normal. These advantages of more sophisticated DBS techniques bring the following challenges, which may require a decade of research before reaching clinical practice because many brain disorders involve neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., dopamine in Parkinson's disease and certain mood disorders). Namely, how do we monitor and modulate neurotransmitters in addition to electrical activity? How do we get multiple microelectrodes into the brain in a minimally invasive manner? In the accompanying article, I address these two issues and offer some potential solutions.},

DBS devices in the era were based on cardiac pacing technology but were greatly modified in implementation due to the unique needs of DBS. Clinical studies in the 1970s and early 1980s have revealed a technique with modest results which did not lead to regulatory approval for the treatment of pain. In the 1980s a new application for DBS emerged in the treatment of movement disorders. Clinical trials confirmed the robustness of the therapy leading to approvals by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe for the treatment of tremor and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Technology based on that used for earlier clinical research in pain was improved by leveraging advances in cardiac pacing technology resulting in the sophisticated and reliable systems available today. In the 1990s scientific exploration began in the treatment of psychiatric disorders which is ongoing today. Simultaneously, studies into the treatment of epilepsy were begun which resulted in regulatory approval in Europe. Suggestions have been made to expand these scientific explorations to other central nervous system dysfunctions. Opportunity remains to improve the technology including individualized and symptom specific stimulation patterns, more physician and patient friendly programming, and possibly closed-loop systems for more situation dependent and effective therapy.},

Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of PD. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis. We additionally propose that developing new technologies, e.g., human electrometer and closed-loop smart devices, for monitoring dopaminergic neurotransmission during STN DBS will further advance this treatment approach.},

Continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely used therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) management. However, the mechanisms underlying DBS effects remain enigmatic and are the subject of an ongoing debate. Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for PD in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of PD. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (BG) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into PD pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop DBS and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop DBS paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the BG-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced PD. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.},

  abstract = {Despite their proven efficacy in treating neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems could be further optimized to maximize treatment benefits. In particular, because current open-loop DBS strategies based on fixed stimulation settings leave the typical parkinsonian motor fluctuations and rapid symptom variations partly uncontrolled, research has for several years focused on developing novel "closed-loop" or "adaptive" DBS (aDBS) systems. aDBS consists of a simple closed-loop model designed to measure and analyze a control variable reflecting the patient's clinical condition to elaborate new stimulation settings and send them to an "intelligent" implanted stimulator. The major problem in developing an aDBS system is choosing the ideal control variable for feedback. Here we review current evidence on the advantages of neurosignal-controlled aDBS that uses local field potentials (LFPs) as a control variable, and describe the technology already available to create new aDBS systems, and the potential benefits of aDBS for patients with Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Chronically implantable, closed-loop neuromodulation devices with concurrent sensing and stimulation hold promise for better understanding the nervous system and improving therapies for neurological disease. Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

MER is often utilized when targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other deep brain nuclei in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), tremor, dystonia and other emerging applications. Microelectrodes are used to detect and measure cellular spiking activity while macroelectrodes are considered more suitable for measuring the collective sum of slow potentials from multiple cells near the electrode, the local field potential (LFP). Precisely how the characteristics of an electrode affect the data recorded is still unclear. Technical idiosyncrasies of some surgical cases allowed serendipitous data collection from a 250 to 6000 Hz bandpassed macroelectrode recording during DBS implantation for PD. Simultaneous recording from both a microelectrode and macroelectrode were compared along the same surgical trajectory. Audio, normalized root mean square of the recorded signal, and power spectrograms were used to analyze the data. The analyses demonstrate similar results in detecting cellular spiking activity when recording with macroelectrodes compared with microelectrodes. This has important implications for the standardization of recording electrophysiological data as well as for the development of next generation closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems.},

In particular, oscillations at around 20 Hz, in the so-called beta frequency band, relate to the cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can significantly improve these motor impairments. Recent evidence has demonstrated reduction of beta oscillations concurrent with alleviation of PD motor symptoms, raising the possibility that suppression of aberrant activity may mediate the effects of DBS. Here we review the evidence supporting suppression of pathological oscillations during stimulation and discuss how this might underlie the efficacy of DBS.

  issn = {1940-087X},
  doi = {10.3791/3993},
  abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., $<$1 cm/$<$1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an SDK that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of ECS mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by ECS. The results from our passive SIGFRIED mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human ECoG data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.},

  abstract = {The current Food and Drug Administration approved system for the treatment of tremor disorders through Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the area of the brain that controls movement, operates open-loop. It does not automatically adapt to the instantaneous patient's needs or to the progression of the disease. This paper demonstrates an adaptive closed-loop controlled DBS that, after switching off stimulation, tracks few physiological signals to predict the reappearance of tremor before the patient experiences discomfort, at which point it instructs the DBS controller to switch on stimulation again. The core of the proposed approach is a Neural Network (NN) which effectively extracts tremor predictive information from non-invasively recorded surface-electromyogram(sEMG) and accelerometer signals measured at the symptomatic extremities. A simple feed-forward back-propagation NN architecture is shown to successfully predict tremor in 31 out of 33 trials in two Parkinson's Disease patients with an overall accuracy of 75.8\% and sensitivity of 92.3\%. This work therefore shows that closed-loop DBS control is feasible in the near future and that it can be achieved without modifications of the electrodes implanted in the brain, i.e., is backward compatible with approved DBS systems.},

  abstract = {Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris\textendash{}Lecar (M\textendash{}L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor signs affecting gait, postural stability, and tremor. These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency ($>$100\hspace{0.6em}Hz). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) onset or cessation affects PD signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during DBS, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all PD patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on PD and none exploring the effect of DBS was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during DBS, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by DBS-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of DBS effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in PD.},

  abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of classical feedback control methods to achieve an improved deep brain stimulation (DBS) algorithm for application to Parkinson's disease (PD). Approach. A computational model of PD dynamics was employed to develop model-based rational feedback controller design. The restoration of thalamocortical relay capabilities to patients suffering from PD is formulated as a feedback control problem with the DBS waveform serving as the control input. Two high-level control strategies are tested: one that is driven by an online estimate of thalamic reliability, and another that acts to eliminate substantial decreases in the inhibition from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) to the thalamus. Control laws inspired by traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) methodology are prescribed for each strategy and simulated on this computational model of the basal ganglia network. Main Results. For control based upon thalamic reliability, a strategy of frequency proportional control with proportional bias delivered the optimal control achieved for a given energy expenditure. In comparison, control based upon synaptic inhibitory output from the GPi performed very well in comparison with those of reliability-based control, with considerable further reduction in energy expenditure relative to that of open-loop DBS. The best controller performance was amplitude proportional with derivative control and integral bias, which is full PID control. We demonstrated how optimizing the three components of PID control is feasible in this setting, although the complexity of these optimization functions argues for adaptive methods in implementation. Significance. Our findings point to the potential value of model-based rational design of feedback controllers for Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that synchronized neural oscillations in the cortico-basal ganglia network may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. In this study, a new model of the closed loop network is used to explore the generation and interaction of network oscillations and their suppression through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Under simulated dopamine depletion conditions, increased gain through the hyperdirect pathway resulted in the interaction of neural oscillations at different frequencies in the cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to the emergence of synchronized oscillations at a new intermediate frequency. Further increases in synaptic gain resulted in the cortex driving synchronous oscillatory activity throughout the network. When DBS was added to the model a progressive reduction in STN power at the tremor and beta frequencies was observed as the frequency of stimulation was increased, with resonance effects occurring for low frequency DBS (\$$<$\$40 Hz) in agreement with experimental observations. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronous oscillations can arise within the network and how DBS may suppress unwanted oscillatory activity.},

  abstract = {Interstitial flow is the convective transport of fluid through tissue extracellular matrix. This creeping fluid flow has been shown to affect the morphology and migration of cells such as fibroblasts, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. A microfluidic cell culture system was designed to apply stable pressure gradients and fluid flow and allow direct visualization of transient responses of cells seeded in a 3D collagen type I scaffold. We used this system to examine the effects of interstitial flow on cancer cell morphology and migration and to extend previous studies showing that interstitial flow increases the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-435S melanoma cells [Shields J, et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 11:526\textendash{}538]. Using a breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-231) we also observed cell migration along streamlines in the presence of flow; however, we further demonstrated that the strength of the flow as well as the cell density determined directional bias of migration along the streamline. In particular, we found that cells either at high seeding density or with the CCR-7 receptor inhibited migration against, rather than with the flow. We provide further evidence that CCR7-dependent autologous chemotaxis is the mechanism that leads to migration with the flow, but also demonstrate a competing CCR7-independent mechanism that causes migration against the flow. Data from experiments investigating the effects of cell concentration, interstitial flow rate, receptor activity, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation support our hypothesis that the competing stimulus is integrin mediated. This mechanism may play an important role in development of metastatic disease.},

Brain\textendash{}computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or \textasciitilde{}15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

To this date, very few studies have tried to integrate third-person data, or data about the neurophysiological correlates of conscious states, with first-person data, or data about subjective experience. Inspired by Morel's invention (Casares, 1940), a literary machine capable of reproducing sensory-dependent external reality, this article suggests that combination of virtual reality techniques and brain reading technologies, that is, decoding of conscious states by brain activity alone, can offer this integration. It is also proposed that the multimodal, simulating, and integrative capacities of the dreaming brain render it an ``endogenous'' Morel's machine, which can potentially be used in studying consciousness, but not always in a reliable way. Both the literary machine and dreaming could contribute to a better understanding of conscious states.},

  abstract = {Effective estimation of the salience of environmental stimuli underlies adaptive behavior, while related aberrance is believed to undermine rational thought processes in schizophrenia. A network including bilateral frontoinsular cortex (FIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been observed to respond to salient stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test the hypothesis that activity in this salience network (SN) is less discriminately modulated by contextually-relevant stimuli in schizophrenia than in healthy individuals, fMRI data were collected in 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 13 matched controls during performance of a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task. After quantitatively identifying spatial components representative of the FIC and dACC features of the SN, two principal analyses were conducted. In the first, modulation of SN activity by salience was assessed by measuring response to trial outcome. First-level general linear models were applied to individual-specific time-courses of SN activity identified using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). This analysis revealed a significant salience-by-performance-by-group interaction on the best-fit FIC component's activity at trial outcome, whereby healthy individuals but not individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater distinction between the response to hits and misses in high salience trials than in low salience trials. The second analysis aimed to ascertain whether SN component amplitude differed between the study groups over the duration of the experiment. Independent-samples T-tests on back-projected, percent-signal-change scaled SN component images importantly showed that the groups did not differ in the overall amplitude of SN expression over the entire dataset. These findings of dysregulated but not decreased SN activity in schizophrenia provide physiological support for mechanistic conceptual frameworks of delusional thought formation.},

  abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength GECIs, ``RCaMPs,'' engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby, the red sensor RCaMP, and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP, are conducted simultaneously, with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and ChR2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the RCaMP sensors to R-GECO1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-GECO1 displays higher Ca2+ affinity and larger dynamic range than RCaMP, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-GECO1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from GCaMP by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

In the phototaxis process, excitation of the algal sensory rhodopsins leads to generation of transmembrane photoreceptor currents. When expressed in animal cells, the algal phototaxis receptors function as light-gated cation channels, which has earned them the name ``channelrhodopsins.'' Channelrhodopsins have become useful molecular tools for light control of cellular activity. Only four channelrhodopsins, identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, have been reported so far. By screening light-induced currents among algal species, we identified that the phylogenetically distant flagellate Mesostigma viride showed photoelectrical responses in vivo with properties suggesting a channelrhodopsin especially promising for optogenetic use. We cloned an M. viride channelrhodopsin, MChR1, and studied its channel activity upon heterologous expression. Action spectra in HEK293 cells match those of the photocurrents observed in M. viride cells. Comparison of the more divergent MChR1 sequence to the previously studied phylogenetically clustered homologs and study of several MChR1 mutants refine our understanding of the sequence determinants of channelrhodopsin function. We found that MChR1 has the most red-shifted and pH-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins' channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination. This combination of properties makes MChR1 a promising candidate for optogenetic applications.

Only one of four currently known channelrhodopsins is widely used in optogenetics, although electrical currents recorded in diverse flagellates suggest the existence of a large variety of such proteins. We applied a strategy for the search for new channelrhodopsins with desirable characteristics by measuring rhodopsin-mediated photocurrents in microalgae, which helped us identify MChR1, a new member of the channelrhodopsin family. MChR1 exhibits several sought-after characteristics and thus expands the available optogenetic toolbox.

  abstract = {Microbial-type rhodopsins are found in archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Some of them represent membrane ion transport proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, or channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1), a recently identified light-gated proton channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ChR1 and ChR2, a related microbial-type rhodopsin from C. reinhardtii, were shown to be involved in generation of photocurrents of this green alga. We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that ChR2 is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. ChR2 desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the ChR2 ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. ChR2 is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane $\alpha$ helices of ChR2 are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that ChR2 may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

They can change their conformation from a resting state to a signalling state upon light absorption, which activates the G protein, thereby resulting in a signalling cascade that produces physiological responses. This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction. Recent cloning techniques have revealed the rich and diverse nature of these molecules, found in organisms ranging from jellyfish to humans, functioning in visual and non-visual phototransduction systems and photoisomerases. Here we describe the diversity of these proteins and their role in phototransduction.

This site-directed mutant approach led us to identify many key features in the evolution of the photoreceptor molecules. In particular, we will discuss the evolution of the counterion, the reduction of agonist binding to the receptor, and the molecular properties that characterize rod opsins apart from cone opsins.

  shorttitle = {Evolution of the Archaeal Rhodopsins},
  abstract = {The amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family (ARF), which was not related to other known proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors. The archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions; H+ pump (bacteriorhodopsin), Cl- pump (halorhodopsin), and two kinds of sensor (sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin). These four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplication(s) before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea, based on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea. By comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree, we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin:halorhodopsin:sensory rhodopsin: phoborhodopsin to be 5:4:3:10. From these values, the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred. The branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping. Using bacteriorhodopsin (and halorhodopsin) as an outgroup, the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsin/phoborhodopsin was determined. By calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point, we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin. The evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin, which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin, and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations. The changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps.},

Its surface and shores are 423 metres (1,388 ft) below sea level,[3] Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is 377 m (1,237 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 33.7\% salinity, it is also one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazk\"ol and some hypersaline lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond) have reported higher salinities. It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean.[5] This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is 55 kilometres (34 mi) long and 18 kilometres (11 mi) wide at its widest point.[1] It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.},

  abstract = {The neural circuits underlying emotional valence and motivated behaviors are several synapses away from both defined sensory inputs and quantifiable motor outputs. Electrophysiology has provided us with a suitable means for observing neural activity during behavior, but methods for controlling activity for the purpose of studying motivated behaviors have been inadequate: electrical stimulation lacks cellular specificity and pharmacological manipulation lacks temporal resolution. The recent emergence of optogenetic tools provides a new means for establishing causal relationships between neural activity and behavior. Optogenetics, the use of genetically-encodable light-activated proteins, permits the modulation of specific neural circuit elements with millisecond precision. The ability to control individual cell types, and even projections between distal regions, allows us to investigate functional connectivity in a causal manner. The greatest consequence of controlling neural activity with finer precision has been the characterization of individual neural circuits within anatomical brain regions as defined functional units. Within the mesolimbic dopamine system, optogenetics has helped separate subsets of dopamine neurons with distinct functions for reward, aversion and salience processing, elucidated GABA neuronal effects on behavior, and characterized connectivity with forebrain and cortical structures. Within the striatum, optogenetics has confirmed the opposing relationship between direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs), in addition to characterizing the inhibition of MSNs by cholinergic interneurons. Within the hypothalamus, optogenetics has helped overcome the heterogeneity in neuronal cell-type and revealed distinct circuits mediating aggression and feeding. Within the amygdala, optogenetics has allowed the study of intra-amygdala microcircuitry as well as interconnections with distal regions involved in fear and anxiety. In this review, we will present the body of optogenetic studies that has significantly enhanced our understanding of emotional valence and motivated behaviors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Optogenetics''.},

  abstract = {The ability to stimulate mammalian cells with light has significantly changed our understanding of electrically excitable tissues in health and disease, paving the way toward various novel therapeutic applications. Here, we demonstrate the potential of optogenetic control in cardiac cells using a hybrid experimental/computational technique. Experimentally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via a lentiviral vector, and sorted and expanded the genetically engineered cells. Via directed differentiation, we created channelrhodopsin-expressing cardiomyocytes, which we subjected to optical stimulation. To quantify the impact of photostimulation, we assessed electrical, biochemical, and mechanical signals using patch-clamping, multielectrode array recordings, and video microscopy. Computationally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into a classic autorhythmic cardiac cell model via an additional photocurrent governed by a light-sensitive gating variable. Upon optical stimulation, the channel opens and allows sodium ions to enter the cell, inducing a fast upstroke of the transmembrane potential. We calibrated the channelrhodopsin-expressing cell model using single action potential readings for different photostimulation amplitudes, pulse widths, and frequencies. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, we virtually injected channelrhodopsin-expressing cells into different locations of a human heart, and explored its activation sequences upon optical stimulation. Our experimentally calibrated computational toolbox allows us to virtually probe landscapes of process parameters, and identify optimal photostimulation sequences toward pacing hearts with light.},

  abstract = {Many simulations of networks in computational neuroscience assume completely homogenous random networks of the Erd\"os\textendash{}R\'enyi type, or regular networks, despite it being recognized for some time that anatomical brain networks are more complex in their connectivity and can, for example, exhibit the ``scale-free'' and ``small-world'' properties. We review the most well known algorithms for constructing networks with given non-homogeneous statistical properties and provide simple pseudo-code for reproducing such networks in software simulations. We also review some useful mathematical results and approximations associated with the statistics that describe these network models, including degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient. We demonstrate how such results can be used as partial verification and validation of implementations. Finally, we discuss a sometimes overlooked modeling choice that can be crucially important for the properties of simulated networks: that of network directedness. The most well known network algorithms produce undirected networks, and we emphasize this point by highlighting how simple adaptations can instead produce directed networks.},

  abstract = {Neuronal network models often assume a fixed probability of connection between neurons. This assumption leads to random networks with binomial in-degree and out-degree distributions which are relatively narrow. Here I study the effect of broad degree distributions on network dynamics by interpolating between a binomial and a truncated power-law distribution for the in-degree and out-degree independently. This is done both for an inhibitory network (I network) as well as for the recurrent excitatory connections in a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (EI network). In both cases increasing the width of the in-degree distribution affects the global state of the network by driving transitions between asynchronous behavior and oscillations. This effect is reproduced in a simplified rate model which includes the heterogeneity in neuronal input due to the in-degree of cells. On the other hand, broadening the out-degree distribution is shown to increase the fraction of common inputs to pairs of neurons. This leads to increases in the amplitude of the cross-correlation (CC) of synaptic currents. In the case of the I network, despite strong oscillatory CCs in the currents, CCs of the membrane potential are low due to filtering and reset effects, leading to very weak CCs of the spike-count. In the asynchronous regime of the EI network, broadening the out-degree increases the amplitude of CCs in the recurrent excitatory currents, while CC of the total current is essentially unaffected as are pairwise spiking correlations. This is due to a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. In the oscillatory regime, changes in the out-degree can have a large effect on spiking correlations and even on the qualitative dynamical state of the network.},

Experimental results have suggested that multiple bursting mechanisms based on a calcium-activated nonspecific cationic (CAN) current, a persistent sodium (NaP) current, and calcium dynamics may be incorporated within the pre-B\"otC. Previous modeling works have incorporated representations of some or all of these mechanisms. In this study, we consider a single-compartment model of a pre-B\"otC inspiratory neuron that encompasses particular aspects of all of these features. We present a novel mathematical analysis of the interaction of the corresponding rhythmic mechanisms arising in the model, including square-wave bursting and autonomous calcium oscillations, which requires treatment of a system of differential equations incorporating three slow variables.},

  abstract = {Motivated by experiments employing optogenetic stimulation of cortical regions, we consider spike control strategies for ensembles of uncoupled integrate and fire neurons with a common conductance input. We construct strategies for control of spike patterns, that is, multineuron trains of action potentials, up to some maximal spike rate determined by the neural biophysics. We emphasize a constructive role for parameter heterogeneity, and find a simple rule for controllability in pairs of neurons. In particular, we determine parameters for which common drive is not limited to inducing synchronous spiking. For large ensembles, we determine how the number of controllable neurons varies with the number of observed (recorded) neurons, and what collateral spiking occurs in the full ensemble during control of the subensemble. While complete control of spiking in every neuron is not possible with a single input, we find that a degree of subensemble control is made possible by exploiting dynamical heterogeneity. As most available technologies for neural stimulation are underactuated, in the sense that the number of target neurons far exceeds the number of independent channels of stimulation, these results suggest partial control strategies that may be important in the development of sensory neuroprosthetics and other neurocontrol applications.},

  abstract = {Object
In single patients with a cerebral aneurysm an external ventricular drain (EVD), an intracranial pressure (ICP) gauge or a combined EVD and ICP gauge placement is necessary after coil embolization and initiation of postprocedural anticoagulation. The aim of this study was to examine the hemorrhage rates of drain placement within 48h after aneurysm coiling and under anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed hemorrhage rates of EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placement in 27 patients within 48h after coil embolization under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet schemes (heparin, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel). In patients with continuous heparin via perfusor the application was stopped periprocedurally. The results were compared to literature.
Results
Four hemorrhages (14.8\%) were observed. Three hemorrhages were petechial and one was by definition a larger hemorrhage with 8mm\texttimes{}10mm in diameter.
Conclusions
EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placements within 48h after cerebral aneurysm coiling and under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet regimens seem to have no increased risk of hemorrhages compared to literature.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons' neighbors \textemdash{} whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away \textemdash{} must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

  abstract = {Optical fibers are commonly inserted into living tissues such as the brain in order to deliver light to deep targets for neuroscientific and neuroengineering applications such as optogenetics, in which light is used to activate or silence neurons expressing specific photosensitive proteins. However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets. The 1.45-cm-long probe is microfabricated in the form of a 360-$\mu$m-wide array of 12 parallel silicon oxynitride (SiON) multimode waveguides clad with SiO2 and coated with aluminum; probes of custom dimensions are easily created as well. The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0.4$\pm$0.3dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3.1$\pm$1dB/cm using the outscattering method and 3.2$\pm$0.4dB/cm using the cutback method; corner mirror loss, 1.5$\pm$0.4dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5mW source will deliver over 1.5mW to a target at a depth of 1cm.},

An ideal therapy would permit correction of activity just in specific target neurons, while leaving other neurons unaltered. Recently our lab revealed that the naturally-occurring light-activated proteins channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (Halo/NpHR) can, when genetically expressed in neurons, enable them to be safely, precisely, and reversibly activated and silenced by pulses of blue and yellow light, respectively. We here describe the ability to make specific neurons in the brain light-sensitive, using a viral approach. We also reveal the design and construction of a scalable, fully-implantable optical prosthetic capable of delivering light of appropriate intensity and wavelength to targeted neurons at arbitrary 3-D locations within the brain, enabling activation and silencing of specific neuron types at multiple locations. Finally, we demonstrate control of neural activity in the cortex of the non-human primate, a key step in the translation of such technology for human clinical use. Systems for optical targeting of specific neural circuit elements may enable a new generation of high-precision therapies for brain disorders.},

Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven ChR2, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The Halo/ChR2 system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells.},

Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch ($\sim$900 pA in vitro), but with a $>$3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1\textendash{}10 mW/mm2, equating to $>$2\texttimes{} increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete ($\sim$100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

Optogenetics is currently the state-of-the-art method for causal-oriented brain research. Despite an increasingly large number of invertebrate and rodent studies showing profound electrophysiological and behavioral effects induced by optogenetics [1, 2], only two primate studies have reported modulation of local single-cell activity but with no behavioral effects [3, 4]. Here, we show that optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons within rhesus monkey arcuate sulcus, during the execution of a visually guided saccade task, evoked significant and reproducible changes in saccade latencies as a function of target position. Moreover, using concurrent optogenetic stimulation and opto-fMRI [5, 6]), we observed optogenetically induced changes in fMRI activity in specific functional cortical networks throughout the monkey brain. This is critical information for the advancement of optogenetic primate research models and for initiating the development of optogenetically based cell-specific therapies with which to treat neurological diseases in humans.},

We implement an efficient ray-tracing technique using Pl\"ucker Coordinates. The Barycentric coordinates computed from Pl\"ucker-formed ray-tracing enables us to use linear Lagrange basis functions to model both media properties and fluence distribution, leading to further improvement in accuracy. The Pl\"ucker-coordinate ray-polygon intersection test can be extended to hexahedral or high-order elements. Excellent agreement is found when comparing mesh-based MC with the analytical diffusion model and 3D voxel-based MC code in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. Realistic time-resolved imaging results are observed for a complex human brain anatomy using mesh-based MC. We also include multi-threading support in the software and will port it to a graphics processing unit platform in the near future.},

  abstract = {Previous work has reported that it is not difficult to give people the illusion of ownership over an artificial body, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying body perception and self consciousness. We present an experimental study that uses immersive virtual reality (IVR) focused on identifying the perceptual building blocks of this illusion. We systematically manipulated visuotactile and visual sensorimotor contingencies, visual perspective, and the appearance of the virtual body in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological measures showed that a first person perspective over a fake humanoid body is essential for eliciting a body ownership illusion. We found that the illusion of ownership can be generated when the virtual body has a realistic skin tone and spatially substitutes the real body seen from a first person perspective. In this case there is no need for an additional contribution of congruent visuotactile or sensorimotor cues. Additionally, we found that the processing of incongruent perceptual cues can be modulated by the level of the illusion: when the illusion is strong, incongruent cues are not experienced as incorrect. Participants exposed to asynchronous visuotactile stimulation can experience the ownership illusion and perceive touch as originating from an object seen to contact the virtual body. Analogously, when the level of realism of the virtual body is not high enough and/or when there is no spatial overlap between the two bodies, then the contribution of congruent multisensory and/or sensorimotor cues is required for evoking the illusion. On the basis of these results and inspired by findings from neurophysiological recordings in the monkey, we propose a model that accounts for many of the results reported in the literature.},

L2/3 pyramidal cells expressed ChR2-EYFP, but histology revealed abnormal morphology and targeting of ChR2-EYFP expressing axons, beginning at postnatal day (P) 33 and increasing with age. Axonal abnormalities included cylinders that enveloped pyramidal cell proximal apical dendrites, and spherical, calyx-like structures that surrounded neuronal cell bodies, including in L4. These are abnormal subcellular and laminar targets for L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses. Abnormalities did not occur in cells expressing GFP instead of ChR2, or in intermixed ChR2-negative axons. Long-term viral-mediated expression (80 d) did not cause axonal abnormalities when the CAG promoter was used, but produced some abnormalities with the stronger $\alpha$CaMKII promoter (albeit much less than with in utero electroporation). Thus, under some circumstances high-level, long-term expression of ChR2-EYFP can perturb the structural organization of cortical circuits.},

Here we describe a method to control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles through the use of a light-gated glutamate receptor (LiGluR), which has recently been demonstrated that supports secretion by means of calcium influx in chromaffin cells. Expression of LiGluR in hippocampal neurons enables reversible control of neurotransmission with light, and allows modulating the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron with the wavelength of illumination. This method may be useful for the determination of the complex transfer function of individual synapses.},

  abstract = {Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that control the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials (APs). Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Malfunction of an ion channel's sensing or gating module can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation of the nervous system with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders.},

Fluence rates are measured using calibrated isotropic probes that are positioned stereotactically. Mathematical models are then used to derive tissue optical properties, enabling calculation of fluence rate distributions for general tumor and light application geometries. The fluence rates in tumor-free brains agree well with the models based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In both cases, the best fit is found for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of 0.57 and 28cm-1, respectively. In brains with implanted BT4C tumors, a discrepancy between diffusion and Monte Carlo\textendash{}derived two-layer models is noted. Both models suggest that tumor tissue has higher absorption and less scattering than normal brain. Temperatures are measured by inserting thermocouples directly into tumor-free brains. A model based on diffusion theory and the bioheat equation is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and predict a thermal penetration depth of 0.60cm in normal rat brain. The predicted parameters can be used to estimate the fluences, fluence rates, and temperatures achieved during photodynamic therapy.},

In this work we numerically model the utility of signals from a small 6-optode time-resolved diffuse optical tomographic apparatus for inferring baseline scattering and absorption coefficients of the scalp, skull and brain, when complete geometric information is available from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use an optical model where MRI-segmented tissues are assumed homogeneous. We introduce a noise model capturing both photon shot noise and forward model numerical accuracy, and use Bayesian inference to predict errorbars and correlations on the measurments. We also sample from the full posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We conclude that \textasciitilde{} 106 detected photons are sufficient to measure the brain's scattering and absorption to a few percent. We present preliminary results using a fast multi-layer slab model, comparing the case when layer thicknesses are known versus unknown.},

Both implicit and explicit finite element schemes for unstructured grids are implemented and discussed. Several application simulations using three tissue grids of varying degrees of physiological accuracy are then conducted, and figures for the optical pathlength of light through the tissue at varying levels of oxygenation are computed. These results are then used to develop a quantitative relationship between the pathlength and the absorption parameter for the three tissue models which we explore.},

  shorttitle = {Special Issue on Optical Neural Engineering},
  abstract = {Neural engineering, itself an 'emerging interdisciplinary research area' [1] has undergone a sea change over the past few years with the emergence of exciting new optical technologies for monitoring, stimulating, inhibiting and, more generally, modulating neural activity. To a large extent, this change is driven by the realization of the promise and complementary strengths that emerging photo-stimulation tools offer to add to the neural engineer's toolbox, which has been almost exclusively based on electrical stimulation technologies. Notably, photo-stimulation is non-contact, can in some cases be genetically targeted to specific cell populations, can achieve high spatial specificity (cellular or even sub-cellular) in two or three dimensions, and opens up the possibility of large-scale spatial\textendash{}temporal patterned stimulation. It also offers a seamless solution to the problem of cross-talk generated by simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording. As in other biomedical optics phenomena [2], photo-stimulation includes multiple possible modes of interaction between light and the target neurons, including a variety of photo-physical and photo-bio\textendash{}chemical effects with various intrinsic components or exogenous 'sensitizers' which can be loaded into the tissue or genetically expressed. Early isolated reports of neural excitation with light date back to the late 19th century [3] and to Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis' work five decades ago [4]; however, the mechanism by which these and other direct photo-stimulation, inhibition and modulation events [5\textendash{}7] took place is yet unclear, as is their short- and long-term safety profile. Photo-chemical photolysis of covalently 'caged' neurotransmitters [8, 9] has been widely used in cellular neuroscience research for three decades, including for exciting or inhibiting neural activity, and for mapping neural circuits. Technological developments now allow neurotransmitters to be uncaged with exquisite spatial specificity (down to a single spine, with two-photon uncaging) and in rapid, flexible spatial\textendash{}temporal patterns [10\textendash{}14]. Nevertheless, current technology generally requires damaging doses of UV or violet illumination and the continuous re-introduction of the caged compound, which, despite interest, makes for a difficult transition beyond in vitro preparations. Thus, the tremendous progress in the in vivo application of photo-stimulation tools over the past five years has been largely facilitated by two 'exciting' new photo-stimulation technologies: photo-biological stimulation of a rapidly increasing arsenal of light-sensitive ion channels and pumps ('optogenetic' probes[15\textendash{}18]) and direct photo-thermal stimulation of neural tissue with an IR laser [19\textendash{}21]. The Journal of Neural Engineering has dedicated a special section in this issue to highlight advances in optical stimulation technology, which includes original peer-reviewed contributions dealing with the design of modern optical systems for spatial\textendash{}temporal control of optical excitation patterns and with the biophysics of neural\textendash{}thermal interaction mediated by electromagnetic waves. The paper by Nikolenko, Peterka and Yuste [22] presents a compact design of a microscope-photo-stimulator based on a transmissive phase-modulating spatial-light modulator (SLM). Computer-generated holographic photo-stimulation using SLMs [12\textendash{}14, 23] allows the efficient parallel projection of intense sparse patterns of light, and the welcome development of compact, user-friendly systems will likely reduce the barrier to its widespread adoption. The paper by Losavio et al [24] presents the design and functional characteristics of their acousto-optical deflector (AOD) systems for studying spatial\textendash{}temporal dendritic integration in single neurons in vitro. Both single-photon (UV) and two-photon (femtosecond pulsed IR) AOD uncaging systems are described in detail. The paper presents an excellent overview of the current state of the art and limitations of this technology, which is increasingly being applied for both photo- stimulation and imaging [25, 26]. Finally, the paper by Pikov et al [27] studies the modulatory biophysical effects exerted by low power millimeter waves on neuronal excitability and membrane properties of cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro. These extensive neuro-modulatory effects seem to include a thermal component (related to the photo-thermal effects observed under laser illumination [28]) as well as a more specific effect exerted by these lower frequency (sub-THz) electromagnetic waves. These new contributions augment five previous manuscripts published by the journal on optical stimulation technology, which reported the development of a fiber-based system for in vivo optogenetic cortical stimulation [29], patterned stimulation systems based on computer-generated holography [23] and on arrays of micro-LEDs [30] designed for an optical retina neuroprosthetic [31], and an integrated system for optical stimulation with microelectrode array recording [32]. Without doubt, many more will quickly follow as neural engineers and neuroscientists increasingly tackle the many challenges that this exciting area poses. We can all expect to hear much more in the near future about the biophysics and implementation of photo-physical neural-interaction mechanisms, the design of new optogenetic probes and patterned-stimulation systems (including stand-alone and implantable systems), further integration of electrodes and optical components into electro-optical neurostimulation systems, and rapid progress towards multiple medical applications for alleviating neurological disabilities and improving human health.

  abstract = {Neural stimulation with high spatial and temporal precision is desirable both for studying the real-time dynamics of neural networks and for prospective clinical treatment of neurological diseases. Optical stimulation of genetically targeted neurons expressing the light sensitive channel protein Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) has recently been reported as a means for millisecond temporal control of neuronal spiking activities with cell-type selectivity. This offers the prospect of enabling local delivery of optical stimulation and the simultaneous monitoring of the neural activity by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We report here a novel dual-modality hybrid device, which consists of a tapered coaxial optical waveguide ('optrode') integrated into a 100 element intra-cortical multi-electrode recording array. We first demonstrate the dual optical delivery and electrical recording capability of the single optrode in in vitro preparations of mouse retina, photo-stimulating the native retinal photoreceptors while recording light-responsive activities from ganglion cells. The dual-modality array device was then used in ChR2 transfected mouse brain slices. Specifically, epileptiform events were reliably optically triggered by the optrode and their spatiotemporal patterns were simultaneously recorded by the multi-electrode array.},

Classically, this approach has been constrained by limitations of lens-based and point-scanning illumination systems. Here we describe a microscope configuration that incorporates a nematic liquid-crystal spatial light modulator to generate holographic patterns of illumination. This microscope can produce illumination spots of variable size and number, and in patterns shaped to precisely match user-defined elements in a specimen. Using holographic illumination to photolyze caged glutamate in brain slices, we show that shaped excitation on segments of neuronal dendrites and simultaneous, multispot excitation of different dendrites enables precise spatial and rapid temporal control of glutamate receptor activation. By allowing the excitation volume shape to be tailored precisely, the holographic microscope provides an extremely flexible method for activation of various photosensitive proteins and small molecules.},

  abstract = {Neuroprosthetic retinal interfaces depend upon the ability to bypass the damaged photoreceptor layer and directly activate populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To date, the preferred approach to this task largely relies on electrode array implants. We are currently pursuing two alternative methods for light-based direct activation of the RGCs. The first method is based on applying caged glutamate over the retina and uncaging it locally to obtain RGC excitation. The second method is to artificially cause RGCs to express Channelrhodopsin II (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. In addition to being non-contact, optical techniques lend themselves relatively easily to a variety of technologies for achieving patterned stimulation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP - DMD) technology, we have developed an optical stimulation system capable of controlled, large-scale, flexible stimulation of the retinal tissue with high temporal accuracy. In preliminary studies, we are performing patterned photo-stimulation experiments using samples of caged fluorescent probes and in rat retinas that were virally transfected with ChR2.},

Advances in imaging and neurophysiology over the last two decades have led to a reinterpretation of some neurologic and psychiatric conditions as primarily disorders of circuit function, or ``circuitopathies.'' These developments have been accompanied by advances in neurosurgical techniques with the increasingly widespread utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to recalibrate dysfunctional circuits. The versatility of DBS as both a probe and modulator of neural circuits is making it a powerful tool to study the human brain, helping provide important details of the pathophysiology of circuit dysfunction. We are currently in a phase of active investigation to determine which circuits and disorders could be treated with DBS. Here we review recent advances in the DBS field and discuss potential future directions in targeted intracranial neuromodulation.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an important and potentially powerful treatment option for the management of carefully selected patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who are not adequately controlled by standard medication therapy. Though considerable advances have been made, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS remain unclear despite its clinical efficacy. It is now widely held that both excitation and inhibition can occur secondary to stimulation, and it is suspected that abnormal synchronized oscillations may also be important in the mechanism of DBS. Other potentially important processes, including blood flow changes, local and upstream neurogenesis, and the modulation of neurotransmitters through stimulation of bordering astrocytes are also being investigated. Recent research has suggested that the temporal pattern of DBS stimulation is also an important variable in DBS neuromodulation, yet the extent of its influence on DBS efficacy has yet to be determined. As high stimulation frequency alone does not appear to be sufficient for optimal symptom suppression, attention to stimulation pattern might lead to more effective symptom control and reduced side effects, possibly at a lower frequency. Stimulation pattern may be potentially amenable to therapeutic modulation and its role in the clinical efficacy of DBS should be addressed through further focus and research.},

  abstract = {We present a new pattern of nerve stimulation--double burst stimulation (DBS)--to detect residual neuromuscular block manually. The DBS consists of two short lasting, 50-Hz tetanic stimuli or bursts separated by a 750-ms interval. The response to this pattern of stimulation is two single separated muscle contractions of which the second is less than the first during nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The ability to identify fade manually at different train-of-four (TOF) ratios was compared in four DBS patterns in which different numbers of impulses in the individual bursts were combined. The DBS with three impulses in each burst (DBS3,3) was considered to be the most sensitive and the least painful and thus most suitable for clinical use. The degree of fade in TOF and DBS3,3 was almost identical at any level of blockade (correlation coefficient 0.96), and the major post-DBS3,3 effect was a depression of the first twitch in TOF lasting less than 15 s. It is concluded that the DBS is more sensitive than the TOF in manual detection of residual block.},

These INs undergo continuous turnover in the adult OB in a process known as ``adult neurogenesis.'' Although the overall magnitude of adult neurogenesis has been estimated, the detailed dynamics of the different subpopulations remains largely unknown. Here we present a novel preparation that enables long-term in vivo time-lapse imaging in the mouse OB through a chronic cranial window in a virtually unlimited number of sessions. Using this preparation, we followed the turnover of a specific neuronal population in the OB, the dopaminergic (DA) neurons, for as long as 9 months. By following the same population over long periods of time, we found clear addition and loss of DA neurons in the glomerular layer. Both cell addition and loss increased over time. The numbers of new DA cells were consistently and significantly higher than lost DA cells, suggesting a net increase in the size of this particular population with age. Over a 9 month period of adult life, the net addition of DA neurons reached $\sim$13\%. Our data argue that the fine composition of the bulbar IN network changes throughout adulthood rather than simply being replenished.},

  abstract = {The efficient transduction of postmitotic cells by adeno-associated virus (AAV) makes it an excellent vector to deliver marker, functional, or therapeutic genes to the mammalian brain. An attractive feature of AAV is that all the viral-coding sequences are removed when engineering the recombinant genome, thereby limiting the extent of cell toxicity and immune response that are often associated with viral gene transcription. Of the seven described AAV serotypes, AAV serotype-2 (AAV2) is the most studied gene-transfer vehicle for in the mammalian brain. A feature of AAV2 transduction in the brain is that the vector remains confined to the injection site and predominately infects neurons rather than glia (2-8). The limited diffusion of AAV2 vectors is beneficial for controlled gene delivery. For instance, targeting therapeutic genes only to brain structures showing pathology would eliminate complications associated with vector diffusion and subsequent expression in healthy structures, and is an important consideration when designing treatment strategies for localized neurodegenerative diseases. The same is true for other experimental paradigms, such as investigating the function of genes in specific brain structures or using marker genes in tract-tracing experiments. Although AAV2 vectors were shown to remain predominately at the injection site, one study demonstrated that the vector itself may undergo axonal transport in inter-regional systems (9).},

Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

Bypassing the immune response to maintain a stable recording interface remains a challenge. Companies and researchers are continuously altering the material compositions and geometries of the arrays in order to discover a combination that allows for a chronic and stable electrode\textendash{}tissue interface. From this interface, they wish to obtain consistent quality recordings and a stable, low impedance pathway for charge injection over extended periods of time. Despite numerous efforts, no microelectrode array design has managed to evade the host immune response and remain fully functional. This study is an initial effort comparing several microelectrode arrays with fundamentally different configurations for use in an implantable epilepsy prosthesis. Specifically, NeuroNexus (Michigan) probes, Cyberkinetics (Utah) Silicon and Iridium Oxide arrays, ceramic-based thin-film microelectrode arrays (Drexel), and Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) microwire arrays are evaluated over a 31-day period in an animal model. Microelectrodes are compared in implanted rats through impedance, charge capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, recording stability, and elicited immune response. Results suggest significant variability within and between microelectrode types with no clear superior array. Some applications for the microelectrode arrays are suggested based on data collected throughout the longitudinal study. Additionally, specific limitations of assaying biological phenomena and comparing fundamentally different microelectrode arrays in a highly variable system are discussed with suggestions on how to improve the reliability of observed results and steps needed to develop a more standardized microelectrode design.},

Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design.

  abstract = {Objective. Chronic neural recording in behaving animals is an essential method for studies of neural circuit function. However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach. We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ($<$5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 $\mathrm{\mu}$m along the full extent of the implant. Main results. Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

Gene therapy trials for Canavan disease, Batten disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, and Parkinson's disease are discussed to illustrate the current state of clinical gene transfer to the CNS. Preclinical studies are under way for a number of diseases, primarily lysosomal storage disorders, using a newer generation of vectors and delivery strategies. Relevant studies in animal models are highlighted for Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB and Krabbe disease to provide a prelude for what can be expected in the coming years for human gene transfer trials, using recent advancements in gene transfer technology.

Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) over the motor cortex to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply "drift" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50\% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

The objective of this review is to bring together research communities in neurobiology, tissue engineering, and neuroprosthetics to address the major obstacles encountered in the translation of neuroprosthetics technology into long-term clinical use. This article draws connections between specific challenges faced by current neuroprosthetics technology and recent advances in the areas of nerve tissue engineering and neurobiology. Within the context of the device\textendash{}nervous system interface and central nervous system implants, areas of synergistic opportunity are discussed, including platforms to present cells with multiple cues, controlled delivery of bioactive factors, three-dimensional constructs and in vitro models of gliosis and brain injury, nerve regeneration strategies, and neural stem/progenitor cell biology.

Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.},

Although most studies have recorded electroencephalograms or spike activity, recent research shows that local field potentials (LFPs) offer a promising additional signal.

Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work.

The local field potential (LFP) reflects activity of many~neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.},

Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

  abstract = {Chronically implantable, closed-loop neuromodulation devices with concurrent sensing and stimulation hold promise for better understanding the nervous system and improving therapies for neurological disease. Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

  abstract = {We developed a new method to estimate the spatial extent of summation, the cortical spread, of the Local Field Potential (LFP) throughout all layers of macaque primary visual cortex V1 by taking advantage of the V1 retinotopic map. We mapped multi-unit activity and LFP visual responses with sparse-noise at several cortical sites simultaneously. The cortical magnification factor near the recording sites was precisely estimated by track reconstruction. The new method combined experimental measurements together with a model of signal summation to obtain the cortical spread of the LFP. This new method could be extended to cortical areas that have topographic maps such as S1 or A1, and to cortical areas without functional columnar maps, such as rodent visual cortex. In macaque V1, the LFP was the sum of signals from a very local region, the radius of which was on average 250 $\mu$m. The LFP's cortical spread varied across cortical layers, reaching a minimum value of 120 $\mu$m in layer 4B. An important functional consequence of the small cortical spread of the LFP is that the visual field maps of LFP and MUA recorded at a single electrode site were very similar. The similar spatial scale of the visual responses, the restricted cortical spread, and their laminar variation led to new insights about the sources and possible applications of the LFP.},

  abstract = {It was postulated that the perceived association of visual features is based on the synchronization of those neural signals that are activated by a coherent visual object. Two types of synchronized cortical signals were found by us in cat and monkey visual cortex, and were proposed as candidates for feature association: (1) stimulus-locked signals, evoked by transient retinal stimulation, and typically non-rhythmic; (2) oscillatory signals, induced by sustained stimuli, and typically not locked in their oscillation phases to stimulus events. Both types of signals can occur synchronously in those neurons that are activated by a common stimulus. Synchronized activities were found in paired recordings within vertical cortex columns, in separate columns of the same cortical area, and even between different cortical areas or hemispheres. The average phase difference between such common oscillatory events was typically close to zero ($<$ 1 msec mean +/- 2 msec S.D.). For the dependence of synchronization from stimulus and receptive field properties, a preliminary 'rule' can be given: the coherence of fast oscillations in separate cortical assemblies depends inversely on the 'coding distance' between the assemblies' RF properties, but directly on the degree of overlap between the assemblies' respective coding properties and the features of a common stimulus. This means that oscillatory events in any two assemblies, in the same or in different cortical areas or hemispheres, are more closely correlated the more similar are their receptive field properties, and the better a common stimulus activates the assemblies simultaneously. Our results can explain some neural mechanisms of perceptual feature-linking, including mutual enhancement among similar, spatially and temporally dispersed features, definitions of spatial and temporal continuity, scene segmentation, and figure-ground discrimination. We further propose that mutual enhancement and synchronization of cell activities are general principles of temporal coding by assemblies, that are also used within and among other sensory modalities as well as between cortical sensory and motor systems.},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation at low frequency (30 Hz) have been used to treat intractable pain of various origins. For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias.

In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction.

In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain\textendash{}computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) include stimulators, infusion devices, and neuroprostheses. They all belong to functional neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulators (DBS) are widely used for therapy and are in need of innovative evolutions. Robotized exoskeletons require BCIs able to drive up to 26 degrees of freedom (DoF). We report the nanomicrotechnology development of prototypes for new 3D DBS and for motor neuroprostheses. For this complex project, all compounds have been designed and are being tested. Experiments were performed in rats and primates for proof of concepts and development of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition algorithm.
METHODS: Various devices have been designed. (A) In human, a programmable multiplexer connecting five tetrapolar (20 contacts) electrodes to one DBS channel has been designed and implanted bilaterally into STN in two Parkinsonian patients. (B) A 50-mm diameter titanium implant, telepowered, including a radioset, emitting ECoG data recorded by a 64-electrode array using an application-specific integrated circuit, is being designed to be implanted in a 50-mm trephine opening. Data received by the radioreceiver are processed through an original wavelet-based Iterative N-way Partial Least Square algorithm (INPLS, CEA patent). Animals, implanted with ECoG recording electrodes, had to press a lever to obtain a reward. The brain signature associated to the lever press (LP) was detected online by ECoG processing using INPLS. This detection allowed triggering the food dispenser.
RESULTS: (A) The 3D multiplexer allowed tailoring the electrical field to the STN. The multiplication of the contacts affected the battery life and suggested different implantation schemes. (B) The components of the human implantable cortical BCI are being tested for reliability and toxicology to meet criteria for chronicle implantation in 2012. (C) In rats, the algorithm INPLS could detect the cortical signature with an accuracy of about 80\% of LPs on the electrodes with the best correlation coefficient (located over the cerebellar cortex), 1\% of the algorithm decisions were false positives. We aim to pilot effectors with DoF up to 3 in monkeys.
CONCLUSION: We have designed multielectrodes wireless implants to open the way for BCI ECoG-driven effectors. These technologies are also used to develop new generations of brain stimulators, either cortical or for deep targets. This chapter is aimed at illustrating that BCIs are actually the daily background of DBS, that the evolution of the method involves a growing multiplicity of targets and indications, that new technologies make possible and simpler than before to design innovative solutions to improve DBS methodology, and that the coming out of BCI-driven neuroprostheses for compensation of motor and sensory deficits is a natural evolution of functional neurosurgery.},

  abstract = {Purpose Both frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (DBS) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. Currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on MR-imaging data. We propose and validate a method for computer-assisted DBS trajectory planning. Method Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to compute suitable DBS trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. A cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. The framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. Candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection. Results The proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. A retrospective analysis on 14 DBS cases of patients with severe Parkinson's disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. Furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation. Conclusions This work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of DBS lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.},

  note = {Chaotic systems perform well as a new rich source of
cryptography and pseudo-random coding. Unfortunately their digital
dynamical properties would degrade due to the finite computing
precision. Proposed in this paper is a modified digital chaotic
sequence generator based on chaotic logistic systems with a coupling
structure where one chaotic subsystem generates perturbation signals
to disturb the control parameter of the other one. The numerical
simulations show that the length of chaotic orbits, the output
distribution of chaotic system, and the security of chaotic
sequences have been greatly improved. Moreover the chaotic sequence
period can be extended at least by one order of magnitude longer
than that of the uncoupled logistic system and the difficulty in
decrypting increases 2\textsuperscript{128}*2\textsuperscript{128} times indicating that the
dynamical degradation of digital chaos is effectively improved. A
field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of an algorithm

  abstract = {Purpose Both frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (DBS) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. Currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on MR-imaging data. We propose and validate a method for computer-assisted DBS trajectory planning. Method Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to compute suitable DBS trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. A cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. The framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. Candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection. Results The proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. A retrospective analysis on 14 DBS cases of patients with severe Parkinson's disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. Furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation. Conclusions This work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of DBS lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

  abstract = {Several variations of microelectrode arrays are used to record and stimulate intracortical neuronal activity. Bypassing the immune response to maintain a stable recording interface remains a challenge. Companies and researchers are continuously altering the material compositions and geometries of the arrays in order to discover a combination that allows for a chronic and stable electrode\textendash{}tissue interface. From this interface, they wish to obtain consistent quality recordings and a stable, low impedance pathway for charge injection over extended periods of time. Despite numerous efforts, no microelectrode array design has managed to evade the host immune response and remain fully functional. This study is an initial effort comparing several microelectrode arrays with fundamentally different configurations for use in an implantable epilepsy prosthesis. Specifically, NeuroNexus (Michigan) probes, Cyberkinetics (Utah) Silicon and Iridium Oxide arrays, ceramic-based thin-film microelectrode arrays (Drexel), and Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) microwire arrays are evaluated over a 31-day period in an animal model. Microelectrodes are compared in implanted rats through impedance, charge capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, recording stability, and elicited immune response. Results suggest significant variability within and between microelectrode types with no clear superior array. Some applications for the microelectrode arrays are suggested based on data collected throughout the longitudinal study. Additionally, specific limitations of assaying biological phenomena and comparing fundamentally different microelectrode arrays in a highly variable system are discussed with suggestions on how to improve the reliability of observed results and steps needed to develop a more standardized microelectrode design.},

  abstract = {Objective. Chronic neural recording in behaving animals is an essential method for studies of neural circuit function. However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach. We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ($<$5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 $\mathrm{\mu}$m along the full extent of the implant. Main results. Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

Such arrays are implanted into the patient's cortical tissue and record extracellular potentials from nearby neurons, allowing the information encoded by the neuronal discharges to control external devices. While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Several toxin-induced animals models simulate the motor deficits occurring in PD. Among them, the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model is frequently used in rats and has the advantage of presenting side-biased motor impairments. However, the behavioral consequences of a unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion have, so far, not been described in detail in mice. The aim of this study was to characterize mice with unilateral 6-OHDA-lesions placed in the median forebrain bundle using several motor behavioral tests in order to identify the most suitable predictor of nigral cell loss. Mice underwent various drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod, elevated body swing, and stride length test). The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial and stable unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions can be established in mice, and that these lesions can be functionally assessed using several different side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.},

  abstract = {The Real-time Experiment Interface (RTXI) is a fast and versatile real-time biological experimentation system based on Real-Time Linux. RTXI is open source and free, can be used with an extensive range of experimentation hardware, and can be run on Linux or Windows computers (when using the Live CD). RTXI is currently used extensively for two experiment types: dynamic patch clamp and closed-loop stimulation pattern control in neural and cardiac single cell electrophysiology. RTXI includes standard plug-ins for implementing commonly used electrophysiology protocols with synchronized stimulation, event detection, and online analysis. These and other user-contributed plug-ins can be found on the website (http://www.rtxi.org).},

  abstract = {We describe General Network (GenNet), a software plugin for the real time experimental interface (RTXI) dynamic clamp system that allows for straightforward and flexible implementation of hybrid network experiments. This extension to RTXI allows for hybrid networks that contain an arbitrary number of simulated and real neurons, significantly improving upon previous solutions that were limited, particularly by the number of cells supported. The benefits of this system include the ability to rapidly and easily set up and perform scalable experiments with hybrid networks and the ability to scan through ranges of parameters. We present instructions for installing, running and using GenNet for hybrid network experiments and provide several example uses of the system.},

  issn = {0006-4971},
  abstract = {Relative proportions of peripheral blood (PB) B lymphocytes (B220\%) as well as CD4 (CD4\%) and CD8 (CD8\%) T lymphocytes differ significantly among inbred mouse strains: B220\% is high in C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BR/cdJ, intermediate in BALB/cByJ (BALB) and DBA/2J (D2), and low in NOD/LtJ (NOD) and SJL/J (SJL) mice, whereas CD4\% and CD8\% are high in NOD and SJL mice and low in the other 4 strains. By following segregating genetic markers linked to these traits in (B6 x D2) recombinant inbred (BXD RI) mice, the study defined 2 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the B220\% phenotype: Pbbcp1 (peripheral blood B cell percentage 1, logarithm of odds [LOD] 4.1, P $<$.000 01) and Pbbcp2 (LOD 3.7, P $<$.000 04) on chromosome 1 (Chr 1) at about 63 cM and 48 cM; one suggestive locus for the CD4\% phenotype (LOD 2.6, P $<$.000 57) on Chr 8 at about 73 cM; and one QTL for the CD8\% phenotype: Pbctlp1 (peripheral blood cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentage 1, LOD 3.8, P $<$.000 02) on Chr 19 at about 12 cM. The study further segregated PB lymphocyte proportions in B6SJLF2 mice by using DNA markers adjacent to these mapped QTLs and found that the Pbbcp1 locus (LOD 5.6, P $<$.000 01) was also important in this mouse population. In both BXD RI and B6SJLF2 mice, QTLs regulating B-cell proportions showed no significant effect on T-cell proportions and vice versa. Thus, PB B- and T-lymphocyte proportions are regulated separately by different genetic elements.},

To test this hypothesis, the H+-sensitive fluorophore 5-hexadecanoylaminofluorescein (HAF) was used to measure changes in H+ from horizontal cells isolated from the retina of the catfish. HAF staining conditions were modified to minimize intracellular accumulation of HAF and maximize membrane-associated staining, and ratiometric fluorescent imaging of cells displaying primarily membrane-associated HAF fluorescence was conducted. Challenge of such HAF-labeled cells with glutamate or the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist kainate produced an increase in the fluorescence ratio, consistent with an alkalinization response of +0.12 pH units and +0.23 pH units, respectively. This alkalinization was blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, and lanthanum. The alkalinization reported by HAF was consistent with extracellular alkalinizations detected in previous studies using self-referencing H+-selective microelectrodes. The spatial distribution of the kainate-induced changes in extracellular H+ was also examined. An overall global alkalinization around the cell was observed, with no obvious signs of discrete centers of acidification.

  abstract = {The design of a macroscope constructed with photography lenses is described and several applications are demonstrated. The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

  abstract = {Laser speckle contrast imaging has become a widely used tool for dynamic imaging of blood flow, both in animal models and in the clinic. Typically, laser speckle contrast imaging is performed using scientific-grade instrumentation. However, due to recent advances in camera technology, these expensive components may not be necessary to produce accurate images. In this paper, we demonstrate that a consumer-grade webcam can be used to visualize changes in flow, both in a microfluidic flow phantom and in vivo in a mouse model. A two-camera setup was used to simultaneously image with a high performance monochrome CCD camera and the webcam for direct comparison. The webcam was also tested with inexpensive aspheric lenses and a laser pointer for a complete low-cost, compact setup (\$90, 5.6 cm length, 25 g). The CCD and webcam showed excellent agreement with the two-camera setup, and the inexpensive setup was used to image dynamic blood flow changes before and after a targeted cerebral occlusion.},

Contralateral responses were generally largest and ipsilateral responses were smallest when using single noise bursts, but the extent of the activated area was large and comparable in all three aural configurations.

In this review we present some basic features of multi-photon nanosurgery and we illustrate the advantages offered by this novel methodology in neuroscience research.

We show how the vascular system can be perturbed through laser ablation leading toward two different models of stroke: intravascular clot and extravasation. Following the temporal evolution of the injured system (either a neuron or a blood vessel) through time lapse in vivo imaging, the physiological response of the target structure and the rearrangement of the surrounding area can be characterized.

  abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of ``primary states'' is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit ``criticality,'' i.e., the property of being poised at a ``critical'' point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to $\sim$2-5 $\mu$m. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of $<$5\%.},

In these studies, three-dimensional spatio-temporal events can only be inferred from two-dimensional surface potential maps. We present a novel optical system that enables high fidelity transmural recording of transmembrane potentials. A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light and collect fluorescence from seven positions, each 1 mm apart, through the left ventricle wall of the rabbit heart. Excitation is provided by the 488-nm line of a water-cooled argon-ion laser. The fluorescence of the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS from each tissue site is split at 600 nm and imaged onto separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The optics and electronics are easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes. The system is used to record the first simultaneous measurements of transmembrane potential at a number of sites through the intact heart wall.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides qualitative descriptions of a variety of lighting and viewing methods (LVMs). These are presented in alphabetical order, since there is no natural structure for such a list (Table 40.1 ). There are usually five elements within an image acquisition sub-system: light source, illumination optics, image-enhancement optics, main lens and sensor. The positions of these relative to each other and the object being observed must be carefully selected, to obtain a digital image that is easy to process electronically. The physical layout of the optical sub-system and the choice of appropriate components are of equal importance. Chapter 7 describes the light sources available, while optical components are discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6. Scanners and cameras and are described in Chaps. 9 and 10 respectively. Chapter 8 explains some of the concepts necessary to appreciate the methods described here. Of particular note is that of an illumination diagram. This explains, in graphical form, the shape and position and of the light source in relation to the widget and camera. Notice that the diagrams included in this chapter are not drawn to scale; they merely suggest a design for the lighting-viewing sub-system in broad conceptual terms. A multitude of combinations of the methods described below is possible.

When designing the image acquisition sub-system, a vision engineer should normally follows the following steps: Look at the widget In a darkened room, move a ``point'' light source round the widget. Rotate the widget as well. Watch the way that its appearance changes Repeat (a) using a broad light source (e.g., stand in front of a window). Ensure that no light falls on the widget from any other direction Bearing in mind the observations in step (1), consult the LVM Catalogue. Choose one or a few possible lighting-viewing methods Build a prototype lighting-viewing sub-system based on the idea(s) suggested by the catalogue Acquire some sample images Process these images using an interactive image processing system, such as QT (Chaps. 21 and 41) or Neat Vision (Chap. 22) Adjust the lighting-viewing sub-system and repeat steps (4) to (5), until satisfactory results are obtained Design and build the target system based on the prototype Step (1) is very simple, yet it is always in danger of being omitted. The phrase that summarises this design process is ``Experiment, look and observe''. Over a period of many years, involving numerous applications, the author has found this procedure to be very effective indeed. Never attempt to design an image acquisition system without moving from the desk!.},

  abstract = {In a departure from previous top-down or bottom-up strategies used to understand neuronal circuits, many forward-looking research programs now place the circuit itself at their centre. This has led to an emphasis on the dissection and elucidation of neuronal circuit elements and mechanisms, and on studies that ask how these circuits generate behavioural outputs. This movement towards circuit-centric strategies is progressing rapidly as a result of technological advances that combine genetic manipulation with light-based methods. The core tools of these new approaches are genetically encoded optical indicators and actuators that enable non-destructive interrogation and manipulation of neuronal circuits in behaving animals with cellular-level precision. This Review examines genetically encoded reporters of neuronal function and assesses their value for circuit-oriented neuroscientific investigations.},

Here we consider a less explored phenomenon; namely gamma frequency synchronisation of neurons in the basal ganglia. Gamma oscillations have been reported in a distributed network involving the basal ganglia, thalamus and motor cortex, and have been described in a wide range of diseases as well as during increased arousal and voluntary movement. In Parkinson's disease, gamma activity is promoted by dopaminergic therapy. These features suggest that its elevation may be involved in the production of movement and this hypothesis is supported by the correlation between the amplitude of gamma activity and limb kinematics. Here we review these data, discuss the functional anatomy of gamma activity in basal ganglia and question how closely it relates to the coding of movement parameters.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to $\sim$2-5 $\mu$m. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of $<$5\%.},

  abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has an important role in many cognitive behaviours; however, the neural circuit dynamics underlying PPC function are not well understood. Here we optically imaged the spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice performing a PPC-dependent task that combined a perceptual decision and memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales ($<$100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.},

  abstract = {In a departure from previous top-down or bottom-up strategies used to understand neuronal circuits, many forward-looking research programs now place the circuit itself at their centre. This has led to an emphasis on the dissection and elucidation of neuronal circuit elements and mechanisms, and on studies that ask how these circuits generate behavioural outputs. This movement towards circuit-centric strategies is progressing rapidly as a result of technological advances that combine genetic manipulation with light-based methods. The core tools of these new approaches are genetically encoded optical indicators and actuators that enable non-destructive interrogation and manipulation of neuronal circuits in behaving animals with cellular-level precision. This Review examines genetically encoded reporters of neuronal function and assesses their value for circuit-oriented neuroscientific investigations.},

  abstract = {Cortical information processing relies on synaptic interactions between diverse classes of neurons with distinct electrophysiological and connection properties. Uncovering the operational principles of these elaborate circuits requires the probing of electrical activity from selected populations of defined neurons. Here we show that genetically encoded voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins (VSFPs) provide an optical voltage report from targeted neurons in culture, acute brain slices and living mice. By expressing VSFPs in pyramidal cells of mouse somatosensory cortex, we also demonstrate that these probes can report cortical electrical responses to single sensory stimuli in vivo. These protein-based voltage probes will facilitate the analysis of cortical circuits in genetically defined cell populations and are hence a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox.},

Its miniaturized integration would enable many new applications based on mass-producible, tiny microscopes. Key prospective usages include brain imaging in behaving animals for relating cellular dynamics to animal behavior. Here we introduce a miniature (1.9 g) integrated fluorescence microscope made from mass-producible parts, including a semiconductor light source and sensor. This device enables high-speed cellular imaging across \textasciitilde{}0.5 mm2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca2+ spiking in $>$200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca2+ spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales. Overall, the integrated microscope is a potentially transformative technology that permits distribution to many animals and enables diverse usages, such as portable diagnostics or microscope arrays for large-scale screens.},

Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to determine an optimal trajectory to DBS targets (subthalamic nuclei and globus pallidus interna) while avoiding critical brain structures for prevention of hemorrhages, loss of function and other complications. Results show that our method is well suited to aggregate many surgical constraints and allows the analysis of thousands of trajectories in less than 1/10th of the time for manual planning. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of computed trajectories resulted in the identification of potential new constraints, which are not addressed in the current literature, to better mimic the decision-making of the neurosurgeon during DBS planning.},

The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5\textendash{}20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1 \texttimes{} to 2.5 \texttimes, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100\textendash{}700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5\textendash{}10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

We describe the equipment and surgical techniques necessary for both acute and chronic mouse preparations, and provide software that can create maps of sensory representations from images captured by inexpensive 8-bit cameras or by 12-bit cameras. The IOS imaging system can be adapted to commercial upright microscopes or custom macroscopes, eliminating the need for dedicated equipment or complex optical paths.

The experimental results are compared with a simple light-cone-overlap model incorporating fiber numerical aperture, fiber and immersion medium refractive indices, separation between excitation and collection fibers, number of fibers, and fiber bevel angle and/or lens focal length. The model and sensitivity profiles are used to interpret the sampling regions for Raman spectra obtained by using each of the probes with a clear, transparent sample (single-crystal sparry calcite), a white, partially transparent sample (acetaminophen tablet), and a set of organic liquids of varying refractive index. The sensitivity of the tested commercial lensed probe drops off symmetrically about the focal point. For both solid samples, the intensity of fiber background follows a profile determined primarily by laser backscattering off the surface, whereas the sample Raman signal follows a profile dependent upon sampling depth.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the principle of reciprocity is valid for light traveling even through scattering or absorptive media. This principle has been used to establish an equivalence between conventional widefield microscopes and scanning microscopes. We make use of this principle to introduce a scanning version of oblique back-illumination microscopy, or sOBM. This technique provides sub-surface phase-gradient and amplitude images from unlabeled tissue, in an epi-detection geometry. That is, it may be applied to arbitrarily thick tissue. sOBM may be implemented as a simple, cost-effective add-on with any scanning microscope, requiring only the availability of an extra input channel in the microscope electronics. We demonstrate here its implementation in combination with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy and with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, applied to brain or spinal cord tissue imaging. In both cases, sOBM provides information on tissue morphology complementary to TPEF or CARS contrast. This information is obtained simultaneously and is automatically co-registered. Finally, we show that sOBM can be operated at video rate.},

  abstract = {Much progress has been made in uncovering the computational capabilities of spiking neural networks. However, spiking neurons will always be more expensive to simulate compared to rate neurons because of the inherent disparity in time scales - the spike duration time is much shorter than the inter-spike time, which is much shorter than any learning time scale. In numerical analysis, this is a classic stiff problem. Spiking neurons are also much more difficult to study analytically. One possible approach to making spiking networks more tractable is to augment mean field activity models with some information about spiking correlations. For example, such a generalized activity model could carry information about spiking rates and correlations between spikes self-consistently. Here, we will show how this can be accomplished by constructing a complete formal probabilistic description of the network and then expanding around a small parameter such as the inverse of the number of neurons in the network. The mean field theory of the system gives a rate-like description. The first order terms in the perturbation expansion keep track of covariances.},

The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

For imaging cells in deeper areas, this article discusses in vivo optical microendoscopy using gradient refractive index (GRIN) microlenses that can be inserted into tissue. Our general methodology is broadly applicable to many deep brain regions and areas of the body. Microendoscopes are available in a wide variety of optical designs, allowing imaging across a range of spatial scales and with spatial resolution that can now closely approach that offered by standard water-immersion microscope objectives. The incorporation of microendoscope probes into portable miniaturized microscopes allows imaging in freely behaving animals. When combined with the broad sets of available fluorescent markers, animal preparations, and genetically modified mice, microendoscopic methods enable sophisticated experimental designs for probing how cellular characteristics may underlie or reflect animal behavior and life experience, in healthy animals and animal models of disease.},

Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

  abstract = {Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is an operant behavioral paradigm in which experimental animals learn to deliver brief electrical pulses into specific regions of their own brains that are considered to be part of the brain's reward pathways mediating both natural and ICSS reward. Several brain sites support ICSS, with the lateral hypothalamus, medial forebrain (MFB) bundle, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) among the sites that produce the most vigorous ICSS responding. Various ICSS procedures have been designed and used during the last decades since the discovery of ICSS. Two of the most commonly used ICSS procedures, which have been experimentally validated and have shown to be reward-selective, are the rate-frequency curve-shift procedure and the discrete-trial current-intensity threshold procedure. In all ICSS procedures, lowering of ICSS thresholds indicates a facilitation of brain stimulation reward, whereas elevations in ICSS thresholds reflect the diminished reward value of the stimulation and thus an anhedonic state. Acute administration of most drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, morphine, and heroin, lower ICSS thresholds in experimental animals. By contrast, withdrawal from chronic administration of these compounds induces elevations in ICSS thresholds, indicating an anhedonic state that resembles the negative affective state of the drug withdrawal syndrome experienced by humans. However, certain drugs of abuse, such as ethanol and cannabinoids, have shown inconsistent effects in ICSS procedures, primarily because of the minimal effects induced by these drugs in the ICSS procedure. In summary, the ICSS procedure provides unique ways to investigate the anatomical basis of reward and motivation and is an important tool for the assessment of the reward-facilitating and anhe$\-$donic effects of various drugs of abuse with addictive properties.},

Much of what we know about drug abuse and drug reward comes from research involving stimulants, and much of this research involves using drug self-administration as an animal model of drug abuse. In this chapter, the example of stimulant self-administration is used to illustrate: (1) the basic methodology of drug self-administration procedures and (2) the behavioral principles that apply to addiction and animal models of addiction. Many variations of the self-administration procedure have been developed to model specific aspects of drug abuse, to assess the rewarding effects of drugs, and to assess the effects of treatments. The chapter describes how these variations are devised by stipulating the behavioral requirements for receiving the drug (i.e., the schedule of reinforcement) and incorporating drug-related environmental cues analogous to those that occur in the human drug-abuse environment.},

  abstract = {Our increasing understanding of the psychological mechanisms involved in the transition from controlled to habitual compulsive drug use, the hallmark of drug addiction, relies on animal models in which the underlying behavioral construct reflects some of the main features of drug addiction in humans, such as foraging for the drug during extended periods of time, habitual drug seeking behavior and drug seeking or drug taking behaviors that are maintained despite adverse consequences. We have placed great emphasis on the development of behavioral procedures whereby animals not only self-administer drugs, but pathologically seek and take drugs in a way that resembles the clinical condition in human drug addicts. Thus, over the last 10 years we have developed models in rats that specifically address the development of habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive cocaine seeking and taking behavior, and even addiction-like behavior. In this chapter, we review the behavioral procedures, namely second-order schedules of reinforcement, two-link heterogeneous chained schedules of reinforcement and the ``three addiction-like behavioral criteria selection procedure'' that we have used in rats to model habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive drug seeking and taking behavior and addiction-like behavior. Although not yet widely adopted, these models have already contributed to the identification of some neurobiological and psychological mechanisms involved in the vulnerability to drug addiction and the transition from controlled to compulsive drug use, thereby emphasizing their great heuristic value in attempts to understand drug addiction.},

  abstract = {Exposure to psychostimulant drugs leads to sensitized locomotor responding, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) overflow, and drug self-administration upon reexposure to the drug weeks to months later. Calcium-dependent signaling pathways contribute importantly to both the induction and expression of sensitization by these drugs. In particular, calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in forebrain regions such as the NAcc, is known to contribute to the expression of several forms of plasticity including sensitization. Notably, pharmacologically inhibiting CaMKII in the NAcc prevents the expression of sensitized locomotion, NAcc DA overflow, and drug taking. Evidence indicates that CaMKII may act both pre- and postsynaptically in this site to influence the expression of these manifestations of sensitization. Presynaptically in DA neuron terminals, CaMKII regulates sensitized DA overflow. Postsynaptically in medium spiny neurons, it contributes to the upregulation of AMPA receptors, the activation of which is necessary for the expression of sensitization. It is conceivable that interactions between CaMKII-mediated neuroadaptations in both of these sites may underlie the long-lasting maintenance of sensitization by psychostimulant drugs.},

  abstract = {The thesis of this chapter is that the unconscious (basic) craving process, consisting of activation within limbic incentive motivation and memory systems, is ultimately responsible for relapse behaviors. The chapter first includes a brief discussion of current clinical conceptions of craving. This is followed by an argument for what aspect of human craving animals may experience. This leads to a description of various animal models (primarily using rats) that indirectly measure activity of a basic craving mechanism. A final section is provided with examples of the utility of animal models of craving illustrated with translational evidence. It is argued that basic craving is amenable to study by animal models of craving that measure motivated drug seeking behavior. Furthermore, reflection on a distinction between conscious (subjective) craving and basic craving leads to the following possible conclusions: one could treat the conscious craving and this would provide some benefit to the addict. But what would remain is the basic craving response to drug-paired stimuli, situations, and even drug-focused thought processes. Reducing basic craving using pharmaco- or behavioral therapies based upon animal model findings may ultimately be more effective at reducing relapse behaviors.},

  abstract = {Eating disorders and drug addiction share many common traits. This includes biological and environmental factors that predispose individuals to develop either disorder, an increased risk for anxiety and depression when the disorders are present, and heightened trait levels of impulsivity and compulsion. Animal models of eating disorders are not as well established as those that model drug addiction, but the research in this area is progressing rapidly. In this chapter, we discuss anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and obesity as these encompass the majority of maladaptive eating behaviors in humans. We begin by outlining the important features that characterize each disorder and that should thereby be present in an animal model. An overview of peptide control of feeding is provided to help the reader evaluate the animal models presented. These are based principally on genetic variation and stressful life events. In general, most animal models based on genetic alterations have limited applicability to humans, at least to date. Those based on stressful life events appear more promising in that they more accurately reproduce alterations in feeding and neuroendocrine function that are characteristic of each disorder. The next obvious step in eating disorder research is to combine the two approaches to determine how genetic alterations and stressful events interact to produce maladaptive eating and physiological changes.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides an exhaustive overview of the current repertoire of animal models for alcoholism research. The chapter covers behavioral procedures modeling different stages of the alcohol addiction cycle, including strategies for investigating ethanol reinforcement, ethanol dependence, binge drinking, ethanol craving, and susceptibility to relapse. Moreover, the description and evaluation of the utility of these models is presented within a historical context, as well as an assessment of specific needs for future model development. The chapter emphasizes that the primary objective of contemporary research on alcohol abuse and addiction is to explain the processes that compel some but not other individuals to drink excessively, the identification of brain mechanisms that support the acute reinforcing actions of alcohol in nondependent subjects, and abnormalities in these mechanisms that are responsible for the development of dependence and the compulsive character of ethanol seeking and use in alcohol-addicted individuals. With respect to the development and successful implementation of valid animal models of self-administration and addiction, a number of issues must be considered in the case of alcohol due to the fact that (a) voluntary alcohol consumption in animals is generally low, except in animals that have been genetically selected for high spontaneous ethanol preference, and (b) that the conditions that make excessive alcohol consumption a reinforcing event in some subjects and not others are complex because they involve interactions among genetic, psychosocial-environmental, and neurobiological factors. Despite these challenges, a wide array of animal models is available that permits investigation of behaviors directed at obtaining access to and consuming alcohol as well as the identification of neurobiological, genetic, environmental, and motivational factors regulating these behaviors in both the nondependent and dependent states. These models also are instrumental for identifying pharmacological treatment targets for intervention at different stages of the addiction cycle and as preclinical tools for evaluating the efficacy of potential medications for the treatment of excessive alcohol use and the prevention of alcohol craving and relapse.},

Brain mechanisms underlying nicotine IVSA, as well as the effects of pharmacological interventions, have also been widely investigated and are summarized. However, the conditions under which nicotine self-administration has been observed do not closely model the way in which nicotine is consumed by cigarette smokers, in two important respects: conventional IVSA procedures typically employ ultra-rapid infusions and high unit doses of nicotine that approximate the content of one or two cigarettes. In contrast, recent evidence shows that rats will also self-administer nicotine in doses equivalent to about two cigarette puffs, delivered into the circulation at a much slower rate that more closely approximates the delivery rate in cigarette smokers. Possibly, adoption of these refinements will help to provide an animal model with greater predictive clinical validity in order to advance the search for more effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.},

The focus of the discussion is on regulation of opiate intake by physiological dependence, pain, and learned habits. Drug intake by animals is fairly well regulated by satiety levels. Under appropriate experimental conditions, a satiety level can be altered by physiological dependence or pain. Furthermore, during self-administration, there are several sources of learning that will modulate drug intake. It is concluded that these drives and learning dynamically interact with each other to influence the direction and the strength of opiate habits.},

The second is to define and characterize the three major triggers of reinstatement to drug seeking that constitute the foundation of this work. These triggers include priming injections of a previously self-administered drug, reexposure to drug-associated cues, and exposure to stress. The role of these triggers in reinstatement will be characterized within the context of an overview of key behavioral findings in the literature and their theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {Drugs of abuse generate diverse behavioral and physiological effects. One feature common to many abused drugs is the phenomenon of ``withdrawal,'' which results from abrupt termination of drug administration. The initial phases of drug withdrawal, often referred to as the ``crash'' phase in humans, are characterized by dramatic psychological changes which may or may not be accompanied by somatic symptoms. The psychological symptoms, including disruptions in affect and cognition, are most commonly observed following psychostimulant withdrawal. This transient state strongly resembles the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans. The majority of rodent paradigms of psychostimulant withdrawal accurately model this human condition, and sophisticated preclinical protocols have been used to quantify psychological changes, such as anhedonia. In the present review, we describe past and current progress in modeling psychostimulant withdrawal in rodents, as well as potential limitations of this model.},

Experimental binges provide a valid model for examining aspects of the gradual progression from drug use to abuse, particularly when attempting to identify environmental and genetic factors that may prompt intermittent behavioral routines to become dysregulated, as exemplified during cycles of bingeing. Here we explore binge behavior in animals with a particular focus on data obtained from self-administration studies that utilize conditions that allow for both unrestricted and prolonged access to cocaine, opiates, alcohol or food. Many behavioral and neural effects of bingeing are shared between these substances, indicating that the repetitive nature of binge behavior for many types of drug abuse may be related to the dysregulation of common neural circuits. Interestingly, intense bingeing occurs with the emergence of two potential changes in behavior; an increase in the rate or an increase in the persistence of behavioral responding. These two changes indicate that control over bingeing may be determined by a number of processes, including sensitization, tolerance, and withdrawal.},

Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine (`state impulsivity') potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead `trait impulsivity' and brain disorders linked to it \textendash{} for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \textendash{} predispose to drug use and addiction.

  abstract = {A variety of animal models have been developed to mimic the interactions between drugs and environment that are thought to play a crucial role in human addiction. A history of exposure to stress, for example, facilitates the development of drug addiction and drug relapse. Furthermore, there is solid evidence that drug-related contextual cues (i.e., environmental stimuli paired with drug taking that have acquired conditioned stimulus properties) can precipitate drug seeking in both humans and animals, indicating the importance of associative learning processes. Finally, there is some evidence (mostly of anecdotal nature) that the circumstances immediately surrounding drug taking can modulate drug intake in ways that are not easily reducible to conditioning or stress. In the past few years some effort has been made to investigate this latter type of drug-environment interaction using animal models. Most importantly, we have recently shown that the context can modulate the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs independently of its physical characteristics. In these studies, some animals were transferred to the test cages immediately before the treatment (Non Resident group), whereas other animals were kept at all times in the test cages (Resident group). Some studies were conducted using a single drug, whereas others employed a polydrug taking procedure. In the present chapter, we will review not only the results obtained using this animal model but also those yielded by translational studies conducted in human addicts. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these findings for the study of drug addiction in humans and animals.},

  abstract = {Among the different behavioral criteria used to discriminate substance dependence (or drug addiction) from other non-disordered forms of drug use, drug intake escalation presents a number of unique features that makes it particularly suitable for modeling in nonhuman animals. This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.},

  abstract = {This review provides an overview of animal models of acquisition of drug reinforcement by discussing research findings from studies that used drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine (METH), phencyclidine, and nicotine, as well as several routes of drug self-administration (SA). Theoretical perspectives are given for the acquisition models indicating that the animal models are valid predictors of human $\-$behavior. Common organismic factors that contribute to the acquisition of drug abuse are also discussed, such as sex, hormonal influences, innate preference for sweet substances, impulsivity of choice, impaired inhibition, and avidity for physical activity. Differential rates of acquisition of drug SA in rats selectively bred for high and low sweet intake, ethanol intake, or avoidance responding are also discussed. Environmental factors such as enriched versus impoverished conditions, and the effect of behavioral economic factors related to drug abuse (e.g., effort, cost/reinforcement) are also considered. Pharmacological factors have also been found to influence acquisition, such as prenatal exposure to drugs, and potential treatment drug can reduce the rates of acquisition in animal models. Interrelations among factors are described, and their implications are summarized. This review adds to previous accounts of acquisition by shifting the emphasis from analysis of the process of acquisition of drug-taking to an assessment of the major factors that are influential in the initiation and acceleration of this process. The goal is to present translatable findings from animal research that are useful for informing prevention of drug abuse in humans.},

However, it is still a hard problem to address, when automation, speed and precision are required and/or the objects have complex shapes or image properties. In this paper, we compare two Active Computer Vision methods frequently used for the 3D reconstruction of objects from image sequences, acquired with a single off-the-shelf CCD camera: Structure From Motion (SFM) and Generalized Voxel Coloring (GVC). SFM recovers the 3D shape of an object based on the relative motion involved, while VC is a volumetric method that uses photo-consistency measures to build the required 3D model. Both methods considered do not impose any kind of restrictions on the relative motion involved.},

This is achieved using a conventional (perpendicular) angle of approach with a probe held in one micromanipulator to visually guide the placement of the angled micromanipulator which holds a second probe. The technique may be used to derive angular approach coordinates for any angle in the coronal and/or sagittal planes. Once the coordinates are derived, they may be used with a single micromanipulator, as in the case of conventional placements. The derivation of the angular approach coordinates involves simple subtraction; no trigonometrical calculations are used. This method is simple and efficient.},

  abstract = {Glycogen serves as a repository of glucose in many mammalian tissues. Mice lacking this glucose reserve in muscle, heart, and several other tissues were generated by disruption of the GYS1 gene, which encodes an isoform of glycogen synthase. Crossing mice heterozygous for the GYS1 disruption resulted in a significant underrepresentation of GYS1-null mice in the offspring. Timed matings established that Mendelian inheritance was followed for up to 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and that $\sim$90\% of GYS1-null animals died soon after birth due to impaired cardiac function. Defects in cardiac development began between 11.5 and 14.5 dpc. At 18.5 dpc, the hearts were significantly smaller, with reduced ventricular chamber size and enlarged atria. Consistent with impaired cardiac function, edema, pooling of blood, and hemorrhagic liver were seen. Glycogen synthase and glycogen were undetectable in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle from the surviving null mice, and the hearts showed normal morphology and function. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common birth defects in humans, at up to 1 in 50 live births. The results provide the first direct evidence that the ability to synthesize glycogen in cardiac muscle is critical for normal heart development and hence that its impairment could be a significant contributor to congenital heart defects.},

  abstract = {Background
Changes in motivational processing may play a role in weight gain and other non-motor side effects in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.
Objective/hypothesis
We aimed to assess changes in aversive and appetitive motivational activation using modulation of the acoustic blink reflex (ABR) by rewarding and aversive stimuli.
Methods
ABR elicited during the viewing of erotic, food, aversive and neutral pictures was recorded in 11 off-medicated patients with the subthalamic stimulation switched ON and OFF, and in 11 control subjects.
Results
ABR to erotic stimuli was larger in patients in the ON compared to the OFF condition and controls (P~\&lt;~0.01). Aversive stimuli caused a larger increase in the ABR in patients with the ON condition than in controls (P~\&lt;~0.05). Additionally, we found a negative correlation of the ABR magnitude to food pictures in the ON condition with weight gain following subthalamic stimulation (P~\&lt;~0.01, after adjustment to OFF condition).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that subthalamic stimulation affects motivational processing. Subthalamic stimulation may disturb appetitive engagement by erotic cues and increase aversive activation in PD patients. Additionally, postoperative weight gain may be related to changes in the processing of food cues due to subthalamic stimulation.},

In addition, DBS research demonstrates the need to re-consider many hypotheses regarding basal ganglia physiology and pathophysiology such as the notion that increased activity in the globus pallidus internal segment is causal to Parkinson's disease symptoms. Studies reveal a variety of apparently discrepant results. At the least, it is unclear which DBS effects are therapeutically effective. This systematic review attempts to organize current DBS research into a series of unifying themes or issues such as whether the therapeutic effects are local or systems-wide or whether the effects are related to inhibition or excitation. A number of alternative hypotheses are offered for consideration including suppression of abnormal activity, striping basal ganglia output of misinformation, reduction of abnormal stochastic resonance effects due to increased noise in the disease state, and reinforcement of dynamic modulation of neuronal activity by resonance effects.},

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a successful therapeutic approach in several patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Hitherto its application was mainly restricted to advanced disease patients resistant to medication or with severe treatment side effects. However, there is now growing interest in earlier application of DBS, aimed at improving clinical outcomes, quality of life, and avoiding psychosocial consequences of chronic disease-related impairments. We address the clinical and ethical aspects of two ``early'' uses of DBS, (1) DBS early in the course of the disease, and (2) DBS early in life (i.e. in children). Possible benefits, risks and burdens are discussed and thoroughly considered. Further research is needed to obtain a careful balance between exposing vulnerable patients to potential severe surgical risks and excluding them from a potentially good outcome.},

  abstract = {Background
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is routinely used as a treatment for treatment-refractory Parkinson's disease and has recently been proposed for psychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome (TS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Although cognitive deterioration has repeatedly been shown in patients with Parkinson's disease following DBS, the impact of DBS on cognitive functioning in psychiatric patients has not yet been reviewed.
Objective
Reviewing the available literature on cognitive functioning following DBS in psychiatric patients.
Methods
A systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, last updated in September 2012, found 1470 papers. Abstracts were scrutinized and 26 studies examining cognitive functioning of psychiatric patients following DBS were included on basis of predetermined inclusion criteria.
Results
Twenty-six studies reported cognitive functioning of 130 psychiatric patients following DBS (37~TS patients, 56 OCD patients, 28 MDD patients, 6 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 3 patients with other disorders). None of the studies reported substantial cognitive decline following DBS. On the contrary, 13 studies reported cognitive improvement following DBS.
Conclusion
Preliminary results suggest that DBS in psychiatric disorders does not lead to cognitive decline. In selected cases cognitive functioning was improved following DBS. However, cognitive improvement cannot be conclusively attributed to DBS since studies are hampered by serious limitations. We discuss the outcomes in light of these limitations and offer suggestions for future work.},

  abstract = {High frequency deep brain stimulation is an effective therapy for motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, the relative clinical efficacy of regular versus non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. To determine the temporal characteristics of non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation important for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we compared the efficacy of temporally regular stimulation with four non-regular patterns of stimulation in subjects with Parkinson's disease using an alternating finger tapping task. The patterns of stimulation were also evaluated in a biophysical model of the parkinsonian basal ganglia that exhibited prominent oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range. The temporal patterns of stimulation differentially improved motor task performance. Three of the non-regular patterns of stimulation improved performance of the finger tapping task more than temporally regular stimulation. In the computational model all patterns of deep brain stimulation suppressed beta band oscillatory activity, and the degree of suppression was strongly correlated with the clinical efficacy across stimulation patterns. The three non-regular patterns of stimulation that improved motor performance over regular stimulation also suppressed beta band oscillatory activity in the computational model more effectively than regular stimulation. These data demonstrate that the temporal pattern of stimulation is an important consideration for the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, non-regular patterns of stimulation may ameliorate motor symptoms and suppress pathological rhythmic activity in the basal ganglia more effectively than regular stimulation. Therefore, non-regular patterns of deep brain stimulation may have useful clinical and experimental applications.},

  abstract = {Brain activity often consists of interactions between internal\textemdash{}or on-going\textemdash{}and external\textemdash{}or sensory\textemdash{}activity streams, resulting in complex, distributed patterns of neural activity. Investigation of such interactions could benefit from closed-loop experimental protocols in which one stream can be controlled depending on the state of the other. We describe here methods to present rapid and precisely timed visual stimuli to awake animals, conditional on features of the animal's on-going brain state; those features are the presence, power and phase of oscillations in local field potentials (LFP). The system can process up to 64 channels in real time. We quantified its performance using simulations, synthetic data and animal experiments (chronic recordings in the dorsal cortex of awake turtles). The delay from detection of an oscillation to the onset of a visual stimulus on an LCD screen was 47.5 ms and visual-stimulus onset could be locked to the phase of ongoing oscillations at any frequency $\leq$40 Hz. Our software's architecture is flexible, allowing on-the-fly modifications by experimenters and the addition of new closed-loop control and analysis components through plugins. The source code of our system ``StimOMatic'' is available freely as open-source.},

  abstract = {Intravital microscopy such as in vivo imaging of brain dynamics is often performed with custom-built microscope setups controlled by custom-written software to meet specific requirements. Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW, as a platform serving this dual role. HelioScan is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, HelioScan provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of HelioScan by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend HelioScan as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

However, analysis of two-photon data is usually performed using ad-hoc solutions. To date, no publicly available software exists for straightforward analysis of stimulus-triggered two-photon imaging experiments. In addition, the increasing data rates of two-photon acquisition systems imply increasing cost of computing hardware required for in-memory analysis. Here we present a Matlab toolbox, FocusStack, for simple and efficient analysis of two-photon calcium imaging stacks on consumer-level hardware, with minimal memory footprint. We also present a Matlab toolbox, StimServer, for generation and sequencing of visual stimuli, designed to be triggered over a network link from a two-photon acquisition system. FocusStack is compatible out of the box with several existing two-photon acquisition systems, and is simple to adapt to arbitrary binary file formats. Analysis tools such as stack alignment for movement correction, automated cell detection and peri-stimulus time histograms are already provided, and further tools can be easily incorporated. Both packages are available as publicly-accessible source-code repositories1.},

Values obtained with the beam traversing the tissue perpendicularly to the long axis of the muscle bundles do not differ significantly from those found with the energy directed parallel with the muscle fibers. Velocity through living human tissues, consisting mostly of muscle, is measured by transmitting the ultrasound through various thicknesses of the arm, leg, and thigh. Specific gravities of the tissues are measured. The characteristic acoustic impedances ($\rho$c values), calculated from the density and velocity data, vary between 1.5\texttimes{}105 and 1.7\texttimes{}105 g/cm2/sec. The imaginary component of tissue impedance is calculated and found to be negligible at the frequencies at which these measurements are made.},

Specifically, the PAM system was redesigned to efficiently collect photoacoustic waves originating from cortical vessels, providing high (70 $\mu$m lateral and 54 $\mu$m axial) resolution images of the mouse brain vasculature with a contrast-to-noise ratio of 25 dB. These findings confirm the efficacy of PAM to noninvasively image vascular structures in the mouse brain and the potential to image mouse brain function by tracking the hemodynamic response.},

We report a scalable method to monolithically integrate microscopic light emitting diodes ($\mu$LEDs) and recording sites onto silicon neural probes for optogenetic applications in neuroscience. Each $\mu$LED and recording site has dimensions similar to a pyramidal neuron soma, providing confined emission and electrophysiological recording of action potentials and local field activity. We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12~$\mu$LEDs and 32 recording sites, into the CA1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 nW light~power, and fast population oscillations were induced~at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells $\sim$50~$\mu$m apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

  abstract = {To characterize information transfer in defined brain circuits involving multiple brain regions and to evaluate underlying molecular mechanisms and their dysregulation in major brain diseases, a simple and reliable system is ultimately required for electrophysiological recording of local field potentials (LFPs, or local EEG) in combination with local delivery of drugs, enzymes and gene expression-controlling viruses near the place of recording. Here we provide a new design of a versatile reusable hybrid infusion-recording (HIME) system which can be utilized in freely moving mice performing cognitive tasks. The HIME system allows monitoring neuronal activity in multiple layers in several brain structures. Here, we provide examples of bilateral injection and recordings of full spectrum of learning and memory related oscillations, i.e., theta (4\textendash{}12 Hz), gamma (40\textendash{}100) and ripple activity (130\textendash{}150 Hz), in five hippocampal layers as well as in the CA1 and CA2 regions. Furthermore, the system is designed to be used for parallel recordings in the amygdala, cortex and other brain areas, before and after infusion of reagents of interest, either in or off a cognitive test. We anticipate that the HIME system can be particularly convenient to advance functional neuroglycobiological studies and molecular deciphering of mechanisms governing long-term memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

  abstract = {Experimentally mapping synaptic connections, in terms of the numbers and locations of their synapses and estimating connection probabilities, is still not a tractable task, even for small volumes of tissue. In fact, the six layers of the neocortex contain thousands of unique types of synaptic connections between the many different types of neurons, of which only a handful have been characterized experimentally. Here we present a theoretical framework and a data-driven algorithmic strategy to digitally reconstruct the complete synaptic connectivity between the different types of neurons in a small well-defined volume of tissue\textemdash{}the micro-scale connectome of a neural microcircuit. By enforcing a set of established principles of synaptic connectivity, and leveraging interdependencies between fundamental properties of neural microcircuits to constrain the reconstructed connectivity, the algorithm yields three parameters per connection type that predict the anatomy of all types of biologically viable synaptic connections. The predictions reproduce a spectrum of experimental data on synaptic connectivity not used by the algorithm. We conclude that an algorithmic approach to the connectome can serve as a tool to accelerate experimental mapping, indicating the minimal dataset required to make useful predictions, identifying the datasets required to improve their accuracy, testing the feasibility of experimental measurements, and making it possible to test hypotheses of synaptic connectivity.},

  abstract = {Brain regions of human subjects exhibit certain levels of associated activation upon specific environmental stimuli. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) detects regional signals, based on which we could infer the direct or indirect neuronal connectivity between the regions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is an appropriate mathematical approach for analyzing the effective connectivity using fMRI data. A maximum likelihood (ML) discrepancy function is minimized against some constrained coefficients of a path model. The minimization is an iterative process. The computing time is very long as the number of iterations increases geometrically with the number of path coefficients. Using regular Quad-Core Central Processing Unit (CPU) platform, duration up to 3 months is required for the iterations from 0 to 30 path coefficients. This study demonstrates the application of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with the parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) that replaces the Powell minimization in the standard program code of the analysis software package. It was found in the same example that GA under GPU reduced the duration to 20 h and provided more accurate solution when compared with standard program code under CPU.},

As a therapeutic tool, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has demonstrated the potential to improve behavioral performance in patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. Since evidence accumulates that NIBS might be able to modulate oscillatory activity and related behavior in a scientific setting, this review focuses on discussing potential interventional strategies to target abnormalities in oscillatory activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we will review oscillatory changes described in patients after stroke, with PD or suffering from SCZ. Potential ways of targeting interventionally the underlying pathological oscillations to improve related pathological behavior will be further discussed.},

Collecting, organizing and analyzing this data can be a major hurdle on the road to scientific discovery. This hurdle can be lowered using the same technologies that are currently revolutionizing the way that cultural and social media sites represent and share information with their users. Web application technologies and standards such as RESTful webservices, HTML5 and high-performance in-browser JavaScript engines are being utilized to vastly improve the way that the world accesses and shares information. The neuroscience community can also benefit tremendously from these technologies. We present here a web application that allows users to explore and request the complex datasets that need to be shared among the neuroimaging community. The COINS (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite) Data Exchange uses web application technologies to facilitate data sharing in three phases: Exploration, Request/Communication, and Download. This paper will focus on the first phase, and how intuitive exploration of large and complex datasets is achieved using a framework that centers around asynchronous client-server communication (AJAX) and also exposes a powerful API that can be utilized by other applications to explore available data. First opened to the neuroscience community in August 2012, the Data Exchange has already provided researchers with over 2500 GB of data.},

  abstract = {Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the ``open metaData Markup Language'' (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key\textendash{}value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in odML-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the odML format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyze and visualize electrophysiological signals. However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs. A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing. To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named ``Neo,'' suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language. In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualization, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats. Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB. Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation. For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization. Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualization built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

  abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis techniques provide a powerful means to rapidly and accurately assess complex morphological and functional interactions between neural cells. Current software-based identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an accuracy of $\geq$95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3) validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3-D context, appropriate for the study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.},

  abstract = {Significant resources around the world have been invested in neuroimaging studies of brain function and disease. Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of ``primary states'' is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit ``criticality,'' i.e., the property of being poised at a ``critical'' point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

Nevertheless, despite several explicit implementations, the integration of first-person data into the experimental protocols of cognitive neuroscience still faces a number of epistemological and methodological challenges. Notably, the difficulties to simultaneously acquire phenomenological and neuroscientific data have limited its implementation into research projects. In our paper, we propose that neurofeedback paradigms, in which subjects learn to self-regulate their own neural activity, may offer a pragmatic way to integrate first-person and third-person descriptions. Here, information from first- and third-person perspectives is braided together in the iterative causal closed loop, creating experimental situations in which they reciprocally constrain each other. In real-time, the subject is not only actively involved in the process of data acquisition, but also assisted to directly influence the neural data through conscious experience. Thus, neurofeedback may help to gain a deeper phenomenological-physiological understanding of downward causations whereby conscious activities have direct causal effects on neuronal patterns. We discuss possible mechanisms that could mediate such effects and indicate a number of directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Neurofeedback (NFB) is emerging as a promising technique that enables self-regulation of ongoing brain oscillations. However, despite a rise in empirical evidence attesting to its clinical benefits, a solid theoretical basis is still lacking on the manner in which NFB is able to achieve these outcomes. The present work attempts to bring together various concepts from neurobiology, engineering, and dynamical systems so as to propose a contemporary theoretical framework for the mechanistic effects of NFB. The objective is to provide a firmly neurophysiological account of NFB, which goes beyond traditional behaviorist interpretations that attempt to explain psychological processes solely from a descriptive standpoint whilst treating the brain as a ``black box''. To this end, we interlink evidence from experimental findings that encompass a broad range of intrinsic brain phenomena: starting from ``bottom-up'' mechanisms of neural synchronization, followed by ``top-down'' regulation of internal brain states, moving to dynamical systems plus control-theoretic principles, and concluding with activity-dependent as well as homeostatic forms of brain plasticity. In support of our framework, we examine the effects of NFB in several brain disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In sum, it is argued that pathological oscillations emerge from an abnormal formation of brain-state attractor landscape(s). The central thesis put forward is that NFB tunes brain oscillations toward a homeostatic set-point which affords an optimal balance between network flexibility and stability (i.e., self-organised criticality (SOC)).},

  abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the reliable propagation of synchronous neural activity is crucial for neural information processing. The propagation of synchronous firing activity in so-called synfire chains has been studied extensively in feed-forward networks of spiking neurons. However, it remains unclear how such neural activity could emerge in recurrent neuronal networks through synaptic plasticity. In this study, we investigate whether local excitation, i.e., neurons that fire at a higher frequency than the other, spontaneously active neurons in the network, can shape a network to allow for synchronous activity propagation. We use two-dimensional, locally connected and heterogeneous neuronal networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that, in our model, local excitation drives profound network changes within seconds. In the emergent network, neural activity propagates synchronously through the network. This activity originates from the site of the local excitation and propagates through the network. The synchronous activity propagation persists, even when the local excitation is removed, since it derives from the synaptic weight matrix. Importantly, once this connectivity is established it remains stable even in the presence of spontaneous activity. Our results suggest that synfire-chain-like activity can emerge in a relatively simple way in realistic neural networks by locally exciting the desired origin of the neuronal sequence.},

Our results reveal that the same neural mass network may process different combinations of dynamical inputs as different logical operations or combinations of them. This dynamical feature of the network allows it to process complex inputs in a very sophisticated manner. The results are reproduced experimentally with electronic circuits of coupled Chua oscillators, showing the robustness of this kind of computation to the intrinsic noise and parameter mismatch of the coupled oscillators. We also show that the information-processing capabilities of coupled oscillations go beyond the simple juxtaposition of logic gates.},

  abstract = {To learn and mimic how the brain processes information has been a major research challenge for decades. Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing (RC) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional RC, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Major impediments to technology scaling in the nanometer regime include power (or energy) dissipation and "erroneous" behavior induced by process variations and noise susceptibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that CMOS devices whose behavior is rendered probabilistic by noise (yielding probabilistic CMOS or PCMOS) can be harnessed for ultra low energy and high performance computation. PCMOS devices are inherently probabilistic in that they are guaranteed to compute correctly with a probability 1/2 $<$ p $<$ 1 and thus, by design, they are expected to compute incorrectly with a probability (1 - p). In this paper, we show that PCMOS technology yields significant improvements, both in the energy consumed as well as in the performance, for probabilistic applications with broad utility. These benefits are derived using an application-architecture-technology (A2T) co-design methodology introduced here, yielding an entirely novel family of probabilistic system-on-a-chip (PSOC) architectures. All of our application and architectural savings are quantified using the product of the energy and the performance denoted (energy x performance): the PCMOS based gains are as high as a substantial multiplicative factor of over 560 when compared to a competing energy-efficient CMOS based realization.},

  abstract = {Motivation
Needle-based biopsy and local therapy of prostate cancer depend multimodal imaging for both target planning and needle guidance. The clinical process involves selection of target locations in a pre-operative image volume and registering these to an intra-operative volume. Registration inaccuracies inevitably lead to targeting error, a major clinical concern. The analysis of targeting error requires a large number of images with known ground truth, which has been infeasible even for the largest research centers.

Methods
We propose to generate realistic prostate imaging data in a controllable way, with known ground truth, by simulation of prostate size, shape, motion and deformation typically encountered in prostatic needle placement. This data is then used to evaluate a given registration algorithm, by testing its ability to reproduce ground truth contours, motions and deformations. The method builds on statistical shape atlas to generate large number of realistic prostate shapes and finite element modeling to generate high-fidelity deformations, while segmentation error is simulated by warping the ground truth data in specific prostate regions. Expected target registration error (TRE) is computed as a vector field.

Results
The simulator was configured to evaluate the TRE when using a surface-based rigid registration algorithm in a typical prostate biopsy targeting scenario. Simulator parameters, such as segmentation error and deformation, were determined by measurements in clinical images. Turnaround time for the full simulation of one test case was below 3 minutes. The simulator is customizable for testing, comparing, optimizing segmentation and registration methods and is independent of the imaging modalities used.},

  abstract = {Background
With increasing research on system integration for image-guided therapy (IGT), there has been a strong demand for standardized communication among devices and software to share data such as target positions, images and device status.

Method
We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering scenarios.

Results
The protocol was able to transfer position data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with latency of $<$10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.

Conclusion
The protocol proved capable of handling data required in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution and latency. The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices and software but also promotes transitions of research prototypes to clinical applications..},

Here we enable paralyzed larval zebrafish to fictively navigate two-dimensional virtual environments while we record optically from many neurons with two-photon imaging. Electrical recordings from motor nerves in the tail are decoded into intended forward swims and turns, which are used to update a virtual environment displayed underneath the fish. Several behavioral features\textemdash{}such as turning responses to whole-field motion and dark avoidance\textemdash{}are well-replicated in this virtual setting. We readily observed neuronal populations in the hindbrain with laterally selective responses that correlated with right or left optomotor behavior. We also observed neurons in the habenula, pallium, and midbrain with response properties specific to environmental features. Beyond single-cell correlations, the classification of network activity in such virtual settings promises to reveal principles of brainwide neural dynamics during behavior.},

  abstract = {We present a structured matrix factorization approach to analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity of each neuron from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. The matrix factorization approach relies on the observation that the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity can be expressed as a product of two matrices: a spatial matrix that encodes the location of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning. We discuss initialization and post-processing techniques that enhance the performance of our method, along with efficient and largely parallelizable algorithms. We apply our method to \{$\backslash$it in vivo\} large scale multi-neuronal imaging data and also demonstrate how similar methods can be used for the analysis of \{$\backslash$it in vivo\} dendritic imaging data.},

  abstract = {We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging $>$100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

  abstract = {The Free-Form Deformation (FFD) algorithm is a widely used method for non-rigid registration. Modifications have previously been proposed to ensure topology preservation and invertibility within this framework. However, in practice, none of these yield the inverse transformation itself, and one loses the parsimonious B-spline parametrisation. We present a novel log-Euclidean FFD approach in which a spline model of a stationary velocity field is exponentiated to yield a diffeomorphism, using an efficient scaling-and-squaring algorithm. The log-Euclidean framework allows easy computation of a consistent inverse transformation, and offers advantages in group-wise atlas building and statistical analysis. We optimise the Normalised Mutual Information plus a regularisation term based on the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, and we present a novel analytical gradient of the latter. The proposed method has been assessed against a fast FFD implementation (F3D) using simulated T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance brain images. The overlap measures between propagated grey matter tissue probability maps used in the simulations show similar results for both approaches; however, our new method obtains more reasonable Jacobian values, and yields inverse transformations.},

In cerebellar folium crus IIa of anesthetized rats, we imaged the labeled molecular layer and identified all major cellular structures: Purkinje cells, interneurons, parallel fibers, and Bergmann glia. Using extracellular stimuli we evoked calcium transients corresponding to parallel fiber beam activity. This beam activity triggered prolonged calcium transients in interneurons, consistent with in vitro evidence for synaptic activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors via glutamate spillover. We also observed spontaneous calcium transients in Purkinje cell dendrites that were identified as climbing-fiber-evoked calcium spikes by their size, time course, and sensitivity to AMPA receptor antagonist. Two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-loaded cerebellar cortex is thus well suited to optically monitor synaptic processing in the intact cerebellum.},

We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging},

Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged fields into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with flexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages.

A spatial light modulator allows tens of user-selected neurons to be targeted for spatiotemporally precise concurrent optogenetic activation, while simultaneous fast calcium imaging provides high-resolution network-wide readout of the manipulation with negligible optical cross-talk. Proof-of-principle experiments in mouse barrel cortex demonstrate interrogation of the same neuronal population during different behavioral states and targeting of neuronal ensembles based on their functional signature. This approach extends the optogenetic toolkit beyond the specificity obtained with genetic or viral approaches, enabling high-throughput, flexible and long-term optical interrogation of functionally defined neural circuits with single-cell and single-spike resolution in the mouse brain in vivo.},

Correlating patterned neuronal activity to defined animal behaviors is a core goal in neuroscience. Optogenetics is one large step toward achieving this goal, yet optical methods to control neural activity in behaving rodents have so far been limited to perturbing all light-sensitive neurons in a large volume. Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with computer-generated holography, were transmitted to the mouse brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity. The fiberscope was tested in mice coexpressing ChR2-tdTomato and GCaMP5-G in cerebellar interneurons, delivering near-cellular resolution photoactivation in freely behaving mice.},

The root of our brain's computational power lies in its trillions of connections. With our increasing ability to study these connections experimentally comes the need for analytical tools that can be used to develop meaningful quantitative characterizations. In this manuscript, we present a new such tool, incremental mutual information (IMI), that enables the characterization of the strength and dynamics of the connection between a pair of neurons based on the statistical dependencies in their spiking activity. IMI is an important step forward from existing approaches, as it has the potential to disambiguate dependencies due to the connection between two neurons from those due to other sources, such as shared external inputs, provided that the dependencies have appropriate timescales. We demonstrate the utility of IMI through the analysis of simulated neuronal activity as well as activity recorded in the primate visual system.},

  abstract = {Commercially available data acquisition systems for multielectrode recording from freely moving animals are expensive, often rely on proprietary software, and do not provide detailed, modifiable circuit schematics. When used in conjunction with electrical stimulation, they are prone to prolonged, saturating stimulation artifacts that prevent the recording of short-latency evoked responses. Yet electrical stimulation is integral to many experimental designs, and critical for emerging brain-computer interfacing and neuroprosthetic applications. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use, modifiable, and inexpensive system for multielectrode neural recording and stimulation. Setup costs are less than US\$10,000 for 64 channels, an order of magnitude lower than comparable commercial systems. Unlike commercial equipment, the system recovers rapidly from stimulation and allows short-latency action potentials ($<$1 ms post-stimulus) to be detected, facilitating closed-loop applications and exposing neural activity that would otherwise remain hidden. To illustrate this capability, evoked activity from microstimulation of the rodent hippocampus is presented. System noise levels are similar to existing platforms, and extracellular action potentials and local field potentials can be recorded simultaneously. The system is modular, in banks of 16 channels, and flexible in usage: while primarily designed for in vivo use, it can be combined with commercial preamplifiers to record from in vitro multielectrode arrays. The system's open-source control software, NeuroRighter, is implemented in C\#, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. As C\# functions in a managed code environment, which may impact performance, analysis was conducted to ensure comparable speed to C++ for this application. Hardware schematics, layout files, and software are freely available. Since maintaining wired headstage connections with freely moving animals is difficult, we describe a new method of electrode-headstage coupling using neodymium magnets.},

Increasing the computational performance of the BCI algorithms carrying out these calculations enables faster reaction to user inputs and allows using more demanding decoding algorithms. Here we introduce a modular and extensible software architecture with a multi-threaded signal processing pipeline suitable for BCI applications. The computational load and latency (the time that the system needs to react to user input) are measured for different pipeline implementations in typical BCI applications with realistic parameter settings. We show that BCIs can benefit substantially from the proposed parallelization: firstly, by reducing the latency and secondly, by increasing the amount of recording channels and signal features that can be used for decoding beyond the amount which can be handled by a single thread. The proposed software architecture provides a simple, yet flexible solution for BCI applications.},

However, in-vivo 1P imaging captures optical signals only from superficial layers and does not optically resolve single neurons. Two-photon excitation (2P) imaging, on the other hand, has not yet been convincingly applied to GEVI experiments. Here we show that 2P imaging of VSFP Butterfly 1.2 expresssing pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 reports optical membrane voltage in brain slices consistent with 1P imaging but with a 2\textendash{}3 larger $\Delta$R/R value. 2P imaging of mouse cortex in-vivo achieved cellular resolution throughout layer 2/3. In somatosensory cortex we recorded sensory responses to single whisker deflections in anesthetized mice at full frame video rate.

The immune deficiency component of these diseases is less severe than that of the severe T-cell immunodeficiencies and therefore some ability to respond to infectious organisms is retained. Unlike severe T-cell immunodeficiencies, however, partial immunodeficiencies are commonly associated with hyper-immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and elevated IgE production. This causative association is counter-intuitive \textemdash{} immune deficiencies are caused by loss-of-function changes to the T-cell component, whereas the coincident autoimmune symptoms are the consequence of gain-of-function changes. This Review details the genetic basis of partial T -cell immunodeficiencies and draws on recent advances in mouse models to propose mechanisms by which a reduction in T-cell numbers or function may disturb the population-dependent balance between activation and tolerance.},

This high resolution, non-invasive imaging technology provides the ability to microscopically evaluate cellular and sub-cellular features in tissue in vivo by optical sectioning. Because many cancers originate in epithelial tissues accessible by endoscopes, confocal endomicroscopy has been explored to detect regions of possible neoplasia at an earlier stage by imaging morphological features in vivo that are significant in histopathologic evaluation. This technique allows real-time assessment of tissue which may improve diagnostic yield by guiding biopsy. Research and development continues to reduce the overall size of the imaging probe, increase the image acquisition speed, and improve resolution and field of view of confocal endomicroscopes. Technical advances will continue to enable application to less accessible organs and more complex systems in the body. Lateral and axial resolutions down to 0.5 and 3 $\mu$m, respectively, field of view as large as 800 \texttimes{} 450 $\mu$m, and objective lens and total probe outer diameters down to 0.35 and 1.25 mm, respectively, have been achieved.

  abstract = {Epithelial cancers account for substantial mortality and are an important public health concern. With the need for earlier detection and treatment of these malignancies, the ability to accurately detect precancerous lesions has an increasingly important role in controlling cancer incidence and mortality. New optical technologies are capable of identifying early pathology in tissues or organs in which cancer is known to develop through stages of dysplasia, including the esophagus, colon, pancreas, liver, bladder, and cervix. These diagnostic imaging advances, together as a field known as optical endomicroscopy, are based on confocal microscopy, spectroscopy-based imaging, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and function as "optical biopsies," enabling tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time without the need to excise and process specimens as in conventional biopsy and histopathology. Optical biopsy techniques can acquire high-resolution, cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale through the use of endoscopes, catheters, laparoscopes, and needles. Since the inception of these technologies, dramatic technological advances in accuracy, speed, and functionality have been realized. The current paradigm of optical biopsy, or single-area, point-based images, is slowly shifting to more comprehensive microscopy of larger tracts of mucosa. With the development of Fourier-domain OCT, also known as optical frequency domain imaging or, more recently, volumetric laser endomicroscopy, comprehensive surveillance of the entire distal esophagus is now achievable at speeds that were not possible with conventional OCT technologies. Optical diagnostic technologies are emerging as clinically useful tools with the potential to set a new standard for real-time diagnosis. New imaging techniques enable visualization of high-resolution, cross-sectional images and offer the opportunity to guide biopsy, allowing maximal diagnostic yields and appropriate staging without the limitations and risks inherent with current random biopsy protocols. However, the ability of these techniques to achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice depends on future research designed to improve accuracy and allow real-time data transmission and storage, thereby linking pathology to the treating physician. These imaging advances are expected to eventually offer a see-and-treat paradigm, leading to improved patient care and potential cost reduction.

While the HRME platform has recently gained popularity as a simple alternative to confocal endomicroscopy, the axial response of HRME in thick, scattering tissue has yet to be described quantitatively. These details are important because when analyzing images collected by HRME, out-of-focus light may affect the accuracy of quantitative parameters such as nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, which has been proposed as a diagnostic indicator of dysplasia or cancer. In this study we investigated the imaging properties of the HRME system by using phantoms simulating scattering tissue with fluorescently labeled nuclei. We directly compared HRME imaging with confocal endomicroscopy in phantoms and in vivo human tissue. HRME images defocused (deep) objects with apparent diameters and intensity levels that are in agreement with a simple geometric model. Out-of-focus nuclei contribute a relatively low, uniform background level to images which neither leads to the erroneous appearance of large nuclei from deep layers, nor prevents accurate imaging of superficial nuclei with high contrast.},

The individual significance of each of these correlated components cannot be established without observing the full behavior. Recently, Wesson [1] concluded that rats display their submissive status by lowering sniff rate following face-to-face encounters with a dominant conspecific. How rats can perceive such changes in sniff rate is unclear. We recorded sniffing and vocal production of rats during social interactions. Face-to-face encounters with a dominant rat immediately elicited 22 kHz alarm calls in the submissive. The large drop in sniff rate observed in submissive rats was caused by the prolonged exhalations needed to produce these calls. We propose that, while submissive rats do lower sniffing rates around face-to-face encounters, dominant rats need not directly perceive this change, but may instead attend to the salient 22 kHz alarm calls.},

  abstract = {Objective. Maintenance of cognitive control is a major concern for many human disease conditions; therefore, a major goal of human neuroprosthetics is to facilitate and/or recover the cognitive function when such circumstances impair appropriate decision making. Approach. Minicolumnar activity from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was recorded from nonhuman primates trained to perform a delayed match to sample (DMS), via custom-designed conformal multielectrode arrays that provided inter-laminar recordings from neurons in the PFC layer 2/3 and layer 5. Such recordings were analyzed via a previously demonstrated nonlinear multi-input\textendash{}multi-output (MIMO) neuroprosthesis in rodents, which extracted and characterized multicolumnar firing patterns during DMS performance. Main results. The MIMO model verified that the conformal recorded individual PFC minicolumns responded to entrained target selections in patterns critical for successful DMS performance. This allowed the substitution of task-related layer 5 neuron firing patterns with electrical stimulation in the same recording regions during columnar transmission from layer 2/3 at the time of target selection. Such stimulation improved normal task performance, but more importantly, recovered performance when applied as a neuroprosthesis following the pharmacological disruption of decision making in the same task. Significance. These findings provide the first successful application of neuroprosthesis in the primate brain designed specifically to restore or repair the disrupted cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Objective. Inferring the times of sequences of action potentials (APs) (spike trains) from neurophysiological data is a key problem in computational neuroscience. The detection of APs from two-photon imaging of calcium signals offers certain advantages over traditional electrophysiological approaches, as up to thousands of spatially and immunohistochemically defined neurons can be recorded simultaneously. However, due to noise, dye buffering and the limited sampling rates in common microscopy configurations, accurate detection of APs from calcium time series has proved to be a difficult problem. Approach. Here we introduce a novel approach to the problem making use of finite rate of innovation (FRI) theory (Vetterli et al 2002 IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 50 1417\textendash{}28). For calcium transients well fit by a single exponential, the problem is reduced to reconstructing a stream of decaying exponentials. Signals made of a combination of exponentially decaying functions with different onset times are a subclass of FRI signals, for which much theory has recently been developed by the signal processing community. Main results. We demonstrate for the first time the use of FRI theory to retrieve the timing of APs from calcium transient time series. The final algorithm is fast, non-iterative and parallelizable. Spike inference can be performed in real-time for a population of neurons and does not require any training phase or learning to initialize parameters. Significance. The algorithm has been tested with both real data (obtained by simultaneous electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging of calcium signals in cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites), and surrogate data, and outperforms several recently proposed methods for spike train inference from calcium imaging data.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in multi-electrode recording and imaging techniques have made it possible to observe the activity of large populations of neurons. However, to take full advantage of these techniques, new methods for the analysis of population responses must be developed. In this paper, we present an algorithm for optimizing population decoding with distance metrics. To demonstrate the utility of this algorithm under experimental conditions, we evaluate its performance in decoding both population spike trains and calcium signals with different correlation structures. Our results demonstrate that the optimized decoder outperforms other simple population decoders and suggest that optimization could serve as a tool for quantifying the potential contribution of individual cells to the population code.},

  abstract = {Relating stimulus properties to the response properties of individual neurons and neuronal networks is a major goal of sensory research. Many investigators implant electrode arrays in multiple brain areas and record from chronically implanted electrodes over time to answer a variety of questions. Technical challenges related to analyzing large-scale neuronal recording data are not trivial. Several analysis methods traditionally used by neurophysiologists do not account for dependencies in the data that are inherent in multi-electrode recordings. In addition, when neurophysiological data are not best modeled by the normal distribution and when the variables of interest may not be linearly related, extensions of the linear modeling techniques are recommended. A variety of methods exist to analyze correlated data, even when the data are not normally distributed and the relationships are nonlinear. Here we review expansions of the Generalized Linear Model designed to address these data properties. Such methods are used in other research fields, and the application to large-scale neuronal recording data will enable investigators to determine the variable properties that convincingly contribute to the variances in the observed neuronal measures. Standard measures of neuron properties such as response magnitudes can be analyzed using these methods, and measures of neuronal network activity such as spike timing correlations can be analyzed as well. We have done just that in recordings from 100-electrode arrays implanted in the primary somatosensory cortex of owl monkeys. Here we illustrate how one example method, Generalized Estimating Equations analysis, is a useful method to apply to large-scale neuronal recordings.},

Typically, neurons are visualized through fluorescent dyes or fluorescent proteins with fluorescence microscopy. After switching to transmitted light microscopy, neurons of interest are re-identified and visually approached in situ with patch-clamp pipettes. Here we introduce a simpler method for neuron targeting. With fluorophore-coated pipettes, fluorescently labeled neurons and the pipette tips are simultaneously imaged at the same fluorescence wavelength in the same microscope field, so that the neurons and even their neurites are targeted without suffering from chromatic aberration or mechanical complication in optics. We did not find that the coated fluorophores affected the electric properties of pipettes or neurons. The novel technique will be wildly available for pipette micromanipulation under online visual control.},

  abstract = {Phase response curve (PRC) of an oscillatory neuron describes the response of the neuron to external perturbation. The PRC is useful to predict synchronized dynamics of neurons; hence, its measurement from experimental data attracts increasing interest in neural science. This paper introduces a Bayesian method for estimating PRCs from data, which allows for the correlation of errors in explanatory and response variables of the PRC. The method is implemented with a replica exchange Monte Carlo technique; this avoids local minima and enables efficient calculation of posterior averages. A test with artificial data generated by the noisy Morris\textendash{}Lecar equation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional regression that ignores errors in the explanatory variable. Experimental data from the pyramidal cells in the rat motor cortex is also analyzed with the method; a case is found where the result with the proposed method is considerably different from that obtained by conventional regression.},

  abstract = {Spiking neuron models have advanced to the stage of accurately predicting the spike times of individual biological neurons for given fluctuating current. Most of the successful models are based on deterministic mechanistic modeling. In order to describe the stochastic aspect of neuronal firing, I propose setting a deterministic model in a stochastic framework, namely, incorporating the multi-timescale adaptive threshold (MAT) model of neuronal spiking into the stochastic framework of the linear\textendash{}nonlinear Poisson (LNP) model in the form of a generalized linear model (GLM). In this setting, the probability of spike occurrence is updated each time a spike is derived from the past probability. Accordingly, the model may account for nontrivial firing patterns of various neurons that cannot be realized with the inhomogeneous Poisson process. The stochastic MAT model is not only capable of characterizing firing mechanisms specific to individual neurons, but may render the statistical inference feasible for the underlying mechanisms from the data. I also examine here two plausible principles for adjusting the model parameters: maximizing the spike time coincidence between the model and data, and maximizing the likelihood. It is found that these principles bring about greatly different characteristics for an identical set of data.},

  shorttitle = {Classification of 2-Dimensional Array Patterns},
  abstract = {In many pattern classification/recognition applications of artificial neural networks, an object to be classified is represented by a fixed sized 2-dimensional array of uniform type, which corresponds to the cells of a 2-dimensional grid of the same size. A general neural network structure, called an undistricted neural network, which takes all the elements in the array as inputs could be used for problems such as these. However, a districted neural network can be used to reduce the training complexity. A districted neural network usually consists of two levels of sub-neural networks. Each of the lower level neural networks, called a regional sub-neural network, takes the elements in a region of the array as its inputs and is expected to output a temporary class label, called an individual opinion, based on the partial information of the entire array. The higher level neural network, called an assembling sub-neural network, uses the outputs (opinions) of regional sub-neural networks as inputs, and by consensus derives the label decision for the object. Each of the sub-neural networks can be trained separately and thus the training is less expensive. The regional sub-neural networks can be trained and performed in parallel and independently, therefore a high speed can be achieved. We prove theoretically in this paper, using a simple model, that a districted neural network is actually more stable than an undistricted neural network in noisy environments. We conjecture that the result is valid for all neural networks. This theory is verified by experiments involving gender classification and human face recognition. We conclude that a districted neural network is highly recommended for neural network applications in recognition or classification of 2-dimensional array patterns in highly noisy environments.},

  abstract = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker\textemdash{}the neuron's encoding time scale\textemdash{}allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

  abstract = {The rodent whisker-associated thalamic nucleus (VPM) contains a somatotopic map where whisker representation is divided into distinct neuronal sub-populations, called 'barreloids'. Each barreloid projects to its associated cortical barrel column and so forms a gateway for incoming sensory stimuli to the barrel cortex. We aimed to determine how the population of neurons within one barreloid encodes naturalistic whisker motion. In rats, we recorded the extracellular activity of up to 9 single neurons within a single barreloid, by implanting silicon probes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the barreloids. We found that play-back of texture-induced whisker motion evoked sparse responses, timed with millisecond precision. At the population level, there was synchronous activity: however, different subsets of neurons were synchronously active at different times. Mutual information between population responses and whisker motion increased near linearly with population size. When normalised to factor out firing rate differences, we found that texture was encoded with greater informational-efficiency than white noise. These results indicate that, within each VPM barreloid, there is a rich and efficient population code for naturalistic whisker motion based on precisely timed, population spike patterns.},

RESULTS: In simulated data TE detected information flow in the simulated direction reliably with false positives not exceeding the rates expected under the null hypothesis. In the LFP data we found directed interactions from the retina to the tectum, despite the complicated signal transformations between these stages. No false positive interactions in the reverse directions were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: TRENTOOL is an implementation of transfer entropy and mutual information analysis that aims to support the user in the application of this information theoretic measure. TRENTOOL is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and available under an open source license (GPL v3). For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly integrates with the popular FieldTrip toolbox.},

  abstract = {Information theory provides a principled and unified statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables (Ince et al., 2016a). This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni- and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods is available at: https://github.com/robince/gcmi We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We demonstrate the benefits of a multivariate statistical approach with examples such as MEG vector magnetic fields (including separate quantification of stimulus modulations of amplitude and direction) as well as considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a two-dimensional response. A particular advantage of the information theoretic framework is its ability to quantify representational interactions between different neuroimaging responses: for example, different cortical regions, frequency bands, time periods or recording modalities (i.e. simultaneous recorded EEG and fMRI). Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals. By combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space EEG data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information (DFI), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the Xi. We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

  abstract = {Information theoretic measures can be used to identify nonlinear interactions between source and target variables through reductions in uncertainty. In information partitioning, multivariate mutual information is decomposed into synergistic, unique, and redundant components. Synergy is information shared only when sources influence a target together, uniqueness is information only provided by one source, and redundancy is overlapping shared information from multiple sources. While this partitioning has been applied to provide insights into complex dependencies, several proposed partitioning methods overestimate redundant information and omit a component of unique information because they do not account for source dependencies. Additionally, information partitioning has only been applied to time-series data in a limited context, using basic pdf estimation techniques or a Gaussian assumption. We develop a Rescaled Redundancy measure (Rs) to solve the source dependency issue, and present Gaussian, autoregressive, and chaotic test cases to demonstrate its advantages over existing techniques in the presence of noise, various source correlations, and different types of interactions. This study constitutes the first rigorous application of information partitioning to environmental time-series data, and addresses how noise, pdf estimation technique, or source dependencies can influence detected measures. We illustrate how our techniques can unravel the complex nature of forcing and feedback within an ecohydrologic system with an application to 1 min environmental signals of air temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed. The methods presented here are applicable to the study of a broad range of complex systems composed of interacting variables.},

  abstract = {Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) provides quantifiable information on the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion in biological tissue. Changes in water diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and DKI parameters in several white and gray matter regions were investigated in a mild controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury rat model at both the acute (2h) and the sub-acute (7days) stages following injury. Mixed model ANOVA analysis revealed significant changes in temporal patterns of both DTI and DKI parameters in the cortex, hippocampus, external capsule and corpus callosum. Post-hoc tests indicated acute changes in mean diffusivity (MD) in the bilateral cortex and hippocampus (p$<$0.0005) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in ipsilateral cortex (p$<$0.0005), hippocampus (p=0.014), corpus callosum (p=0.031) and contralateral external capsule (p=0.011). These changes returned to baseline by the sub-acute stage. However, mean kurtosis (MK) was significantly elevated at the sub-acute stages in all ipsilateral regions and scaled inversely with the distance from the impacted site (cortex and corpus callosum: p$<$0.0005; external capsule: p=0.003; hippocampus: p=0.011). Further, at the sub-acute stage increased MK was also observed in the contralateral regions compared to baseline (cortex: p=0.032; hippocampus: p=0.039) while no change was observed with MD and FA. An increase in mean kurtosis was associated with increased reactive astrogliosis from immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results suggest that DKI is sensitive to microstructural changes associated with reactive astrogliosis which may be missed by standard DTI parameters alone. Monitoring changes in MK allows the investigation of molecular and morphological changes in vivo due to reactive astrogliosis and may complement information available from standard DTI parameters. To date the use of diffusion tensor imaging has been limited to study changes in white matter integrity following traumatic insults. Given the sensitivity of DKI to detect microstructural changes even in the gray matter in vivo, allows the extension of the technique to understand patho-morphological changes in the whole brain following a traumatic insult.},

  abstract = {The application of pattern classification techniques to physiological data has undergone rapid expansion. Tasks as varied as the diagnosis of disease from magnetic resonance images, brain\textendash{}computer interfaces for the disabled, and the decoding of brain functioning based on electrical activity have been accomplished quite successfully with pattern classification. These classifiers have been further applied in complex cognitive tasks to improve performance, in one example as an input to adaptive automation. In order to produce generalizable results and facilitate the development of practical systems, these techniques should be stable across repeated sessions. This paper describes the application of three popular pattern classification techniques to EEG data obtained from asymptotically trained subjects performing a complex multitask across five days in one month. All three classifiers performed well above chance levels. The performance of all three was significantly negatively impacted by classifying across days; however two modifications are presented that substantially reduce misclassifications. The results demonstrate that with proper methods, pattern classification is stable enough across days and weeks to be a valid, useful approach.},

  abstract = {Task-related hemodynamic responses contribute prominently to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high $<$strong$>$\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}$<$/strong$>$, the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.},

  abstract = {We propose an original method for detecting and localizing anomalous motion patterns in videos from a camera view -based motion representation perspective. Anomalous motion should be taken in a broad sense, i.e., unexpected, abnormal, singular, irregular, or unusual motion. Identifying distinctive dynamic information at any time point and at any image location in a sequence of images is a key requirement in many situations and applications. The proposed method relies on so-called labeled affine flows (LAF) involving both affine velocity vectors and affine motion classes. At every pixel a motion class is inferred from the affine motion model selected in a set of candidate models estimated over a collection of windows. Then, the image is subdivided in blocks where motion class histograms weighted by the affine motion vector magnitudes are computed. They are compared blockwise to histograms of normal behaviours with a dedicated distance. More specifically, we introduce the local outlier factor (LOF) to detect anomalous blocks. LOF is a local flexible measure of the relative density of data points in a feature space, here the space of LAF histograms. By thresholding the LOF value, we can detect an anomalous motion pattern in any block at any time instant of the video sequence. The threshold value is automatically set in each block by means of statistical arguments. We report comparative experiments on several real video datasets, demonstrating that our method is highly competitive for the intricate task of detecting different types of anomalous motion in videos. Specifically, we obtain very competitive results on all the tested datasets: 99.2 $\backslash$\% AUC for UMN, 82.8 $\backslash$\% AUC for UCSD, and 95.73 $\backslash$\% accuracy for PETS 2009, at the frame level.},

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between neuronal oscillations is tightly associated with cognitive processes, including learning, attention and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of FUS on PAC between neuronal oscillations and established the relationship between the PAC index and ultrasonic intensity. The rat hippocampus was stimulated using focused ultrasound at different spatial-average pulse-average ultrasonic intensities (3.9 W/cm2, 9.6 W/cm2, and 19.2 W/cm2). The local field potentials (LFPs) in the rat hippocampus were recorded before and after FUS. Then, we analyzed PAC between neuronal oscillations using a PAC calculation algorithm. Our results showed that FUS significantly modulated PAC between the theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands and between the alpha (9-13 Hz) and ripple (81-200 Hz) bands in the rat hippocampus, and PAC increased with incremental increases in ultrasonic intensity.},

However, the relatively limited computational power of embedded platforms is considered as a bottleneck for many vision applications, necessitating optimization. OpenVX is a standardized interface, released in late 2014, in an attempt to provide both system and kernel level optimization to vision applications. With OpenVX, Vision processing are modeled with coarse-grained data flow graphs, which can be optimized and accelerated by the platform implementer. Current full implementations of OpenVX are given in the programming language C, which does not support advanced programming paradigms such as object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, nor does it have runtime or type-checking. Here we present a python-based full Implementation of OpenVX, which eliminates much of the discrepancies between the object-oriented paradigm used by many modern applications and the native C implementations. Our open-source implementation can be used for rapid development of OpenVX applications in embedded platforms. Demonstration includes static and real-time image acquisition and processing using a Raspberry Pi and a GoPro camera. Code is given as supplementary information.

Navigation problems on uneven terrains and detection of the moving objects while the robot is itself in motion are the core problems that omnidirectional systems tackle. The proposed omnidirectional system is a compact and a rigid vision system with dioptric cameras that provide a 360 degrees field-of-view in horizontal and vertical, with no blind spot in their site combined with a high-resolution stereo camera to monitor anterior field-of-view for a more accurate perception with depth information of the scene.

  abstract = {We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the     X i    . We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work. The experiment results show that, PipeLayer achieves the speedup of 42.45x compared with GPU platform on average. The average energy saving of PipeLayer compared with GPU implementation is 7.17x.},

  abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and Artificial Life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

However, formal information theoretic definitions until very recently were only available for information transfer and storage, not for modification. This has changed with the extension of Shannon information theory via the decomposition of the mutual information between inputs to and the output of a process into unique, shared and synergistic contributions from the inputs, called a partial information decomposition (PID). The synergistic contribution in particular has been identified as the basis for a definition of information modification. We here review the requirements for a functional definition of information modification in neuroscience, and apply a recently proposed measure of information modification to investigate the developmental trajectory of information modification in a culture of neurons vitro, using partial information decomposition. We found that modification rose with maturation, but ultimately collapsed when redundant information among neurons took over. This indicates that this particular developing neural system initially developed intricate processing capabilities, but ultimately displayed information processing that was highly similar across neurons, possibly due to a lack of external inputs. We close by pointing out the enormous promise PID and the analysis of information modification hold for the understanding of neural systems.},

  shorttitle = {Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement},
  abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z $<$ 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

This two-way communication allows us to monitor the state of the brain and its composite networks and cells as well as to influence them to treat disease or repair/restore sensory or motor function. To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.

In this paper, we study the wireless transmission of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We propose the use of a compressed sensing (CS) framework to efficiently compress these signals at the sensor node. Our framework exploits both the temporal correlation within EEG signals and the spatial correlations amongst the EEG channels. We show that our framework is up to eight times more energy efficient than the typical wavelet compression method in terms of compression and encoding computations and wireless transmission. We also show that for a fixed compression ratio, our method achieves a better reconstruction quality than the CS-based state-of-the art method. We finally demonstrate that our method is robust to measurement noise and to packet loss and that it is applicable to a wide range of EEG signal types.},

While the indicators for imaging activity have improved significantly over the last decade, tools for analysing optical data have not kept pace. Most available analysis tools are limited in their flexibility and applicability to datasets obtained at different spatial scales. Here, we present SamuROI (Structured analysis of multiple user-defined ROIs), an open source Python-based analysis environment for imaging data. SamuROI simplifies exploratory analysis and visualization of image series of fluorescence changes in complex structures over time and is readily applicable at different spatial scales. In this paper, we show the utility of SamuROI in Ca(2+)-imaging based applications at three spatial scales: the micro-scale (i.e., sub-cellular compartments including cell bodies, dendrites and spines); the meso-scale, (i.e., whole cell and population imaging with single-cell resolution); and the macro-scale (i.e., imaging of changes in bulk fluorescence in large brain areas, without cellular resolution). The software described here provides a graphical user interface for intuitive data exploration and region of interest (ROI) management that can be used interactively within Jupyter Notebook: a publicly available interactive Python platform that allows simple integration of our software with existing tools for automated ROI generation and post-processing, as well as custom analysis pipelines. SamuROI software, source code and installation instructions are publicly available on GitHub and documentation is available online. SamuROI reduces the energy barrier for manual exploration and semi-automated analysis of spatially complex Ca(2+) imaging datasets, particularly when these have been acquired at different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic understanding of how the brain gives rise to complex behavioral and cognitive functions is one of science's grand challenges. The technical challenges that we face as we attempt to gain a systems-level understanding of the brain are manifold. The brain's structural complexity requires us to push the limit of imaging resolution and depth, while being able to cover large areas, resulting in enormous data acquisition and processing needs. Furthermore, it is necessary to detect functional activities and `map' them onto the structural features. The functional activity occurs at multiple levels, using electrical and chemical signals. Certain electrical signals are only decipherable with sub-millisecond timescale resolution, while other modes of signals occur in minutes to hours. For these reasons, there is a wide consensus that new tools are necessary to undertake this daunting task. Optical techniques, due to their versatile and scalable nature, have great potentials to answer these challenges. Optical microscopy can now image beyond the diffraction limit, record multiple types of brain activity, and trace structural features across large areas of tissue. Genetically encoded molecular tools opened doors to controlling and detecting neural activity using light in specific cell types within the intact brain. Novel sample preparation methods that reduce light scattering have been developed, allowing whole brain imaging in rodent models. Adaptive optical methods have the potential to resolve images from deep brain regions. In this roadmap article, we showcase a few major advances in this area, survey the current challenges, and identify potential future needs that may be used as a guideline for the next steps to be taken.},

  abstract = {Objective . Chronic neural recording in behaving animals is an essential method for studies of neural circuit function. However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach . We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ($<$5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 $\mathrm{\mu}$m along the full extent of the implant. Main results . Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

  abstract = {Objective . Fluorescence imaging through head-mounted microscopes in freely behaving animals is becoming a standard method to study neural circuit function. Flexible, open-source designs are needed to spur evolution of the method. Approach . We describe a miniature microscope for single-photon fluorescence imaging in freely behaving animals. The device is made from 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components. These microscopes weigh less than 1.8 g, can be configured to image a variety of fluorophores, and can be used wirelessly or in conjunction with active commutators. Microscope control software, based in Swift for macOS, provides low-latency image processing capabilities for closed-loop, or BMI, experiments. Main results . Miniature microscopes were deployed in the songbird premotor region HVC (used as a proper name), in singing zebra finches. Individual neurons yield temporally precise patterns of calcium activity that are consistent over repeated renditions of song. Several cells were tracked over timescales of weeks and months, providing an opportunity to study learning related changes in HVC. Significance . 3D printed miniature microscopes, composed completely of consumer grade components, are a cost-effective, modular option for head-mounting imaging. These easily constructed and customizable tools provide access to cell-type specific neural ensembles over timescales of weeks.},

This is not an easy task as most subcellular recording techniques require absolute head stability. The Go/No-Go sensory task is a powerful decision-driven task that enables an animal to report a binary decision during head-fixation. Here we discuss how to set up an Arduino and Python based platform system to control a Go/No-Go sensory behavior paradigm. Using an Arduino micro-controller and python-based custom written program, a reward can be delivered to the animal depending on the decision reported. We discuss the various components required to build the behavioral apparatus that can control and report such a sensory stimulus paradigm. This system enables the end user to control the behavioral testing in real-time and therefore it provides a strong custom-made platform for probing the neural basis of behavior.},

  abstract = {$<$p$><$br/$>$Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a blue-light-gated ion channel that can be used to stimulate genetically defined neurons reproducibly, rapidly and non-invasively. Existing approaches for delivering light to cells expressing ChR2 rely upon microscopes, lasers, arc lamps and shutters, all of which are relatively expensive and are not readily scalable for use on more than one brain region or animal at a time. In this paper, we describe an inexpensive method for delivering blue light locally and with millisecond precision to cells expressing ChR2. We accomplished this by coupling the light from a high-intensity blue light-emitting diode (LED; XLamp XR-E from CREE) into an optical fiber. When positioned in proximity to ChR2-expressing HEK293 cells, this fiber-coupled LED provided localized illumination of up to 32~mW/mm2 and generated ChR2 photocurrents as efficiently as wide-field mercury arc lamp illumination. This fiber-coupled LED was also used to photostimulate action potentials in ChR2-expressing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. LED light power and pulse frequency were controlled with an inexpensive, custom-built amplifier circuit. This scalable fiber-coupled LED system can be used to deliver light independent of the microscope objective and could, in principle, deliver light in parallel to multiple brain regions or to multiple genetically engineered animals.$<$/p$>$},

We propose a new framework to capture the key principles of how local activity influences global computation, i.e., describing the propagation of information and thus the broadness of communication driven by local activity. More specifically, we consider the diversity in space (nodes or brain regions) over time using the concept of intrinsic ignition, which are naturally occurring intrinsic perturbations reflecting the capability of a given brain area to propagate neuronal activity to other regions in a given brain state. Characterizing the profile of intrinsic ignition for a given brain state provides insight into the precise nature of hierarchical information processing. Combining this data-driven method with a causal whole-brain computational model can provide novel insights into the imbalance of brain states found in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Much recent work in systems neuroscience has focused on how dynamic interactions between different cortical regions underlie complex brain functions such as motor coordination, language, and emotional regulation. Various studies using neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques have suggested that in many neuropsychiatric disorders, these dynamic brain networks are dysregulated. Here we review the utility of combined noninvasive brain stimulation and neuroimaging approaches towards greater understanding of dynamic brain networks in health and disease. Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, use electromagnetic principles to noninvasively alter brain activity, and induce focal but also network effects beyond the stimulation site. When combined with brain imaging techniques such as functional MRI, PET and EEG, these brain stimulation techniques enable a causal assessment of the interaction between different network components, and their respective functional roles. The same techniques can also be applied to explore hypotheses regarding the changes in functional connectivity that occur during task performance and in various disease states such as stroke, depression and schizophrenia.

  abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are a promising means for restoring communication to patients suffering from ``locked-in'' syndrome. Research to improve system performance primarily focuses on means to overcome the low signal to noise ratio of electroencephalogric (EEG) recordings. However, the literature and methods are difficult to compare due to the array of evaluation metrics and assumptions underlying them, including that: 1) all characters are equally probable, 2) character selection is memoryless, and 3) errors occur completely at random. The standardization of evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the amount of information contained in BCI language output is critical to make progress. We present a mutual information-based metric that incorporates prior information and a model of systematic errors. The parameters of a system used in one study were re-optimized, showing that the metric used in optimization significantly affects the parameter values chosen and the resulting system performance. The results of 11 BCI communication studies were then evaluated using different metrics, including those previously used in BCI literature and the newly advocated metric. Six studies' results varied based on the metric used for evaluation and the proposed metric produced results that differed from those originally published in two of the studies. Standardizing metrics to accurately reflect the rate of information transmission is critical to properly evaluate and compare BCI communication systems and advance the field in an unbiased manner.},

Mathematical models are used to predict the distribution of out-of-focus light caused by the inherent optical limitations of the instrument, which can then be compensated for using computer algorithms. This unit will review the theory of image formation and characteristics of the point spread function (PSF) based on the instrument modality and objective lens parameters. A variety of commonly used deblurring and deconvolution methods are described, and their applications to sample datasets are illustrated to show the performance of each algorithm. Steps for setting up the image acquisition to acquire data suitable for deconvolution are described, and the challenge of maximizing signal levels while minimizing light exposure addressed.

However, achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical microscopes that have been optimized for conventional real-space imaging. Here we present a detailed framework for analyzing the performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus, and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In addition, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this analysis have been made publicly available as a resource for future studies.},

Update (9/14/2015, Version 2, filenames annotated with "\_v2" suffix):~For all objectives files and the objective catalog, the immersion oil layer semi-diameter has been changed to float so as to prevent unrealistic vignetting that may otherwise occur. Additionally, for all multiconfiguration files, the "before image plane" configuration has been modified. Specifically, the position of the Bertrand Lens has been modified so that it correctly images the BFP image onto the real image plane. In all cases, this required a shift in the position of the Bertrand Lens of \textasciitilde{}1cm further from the tube lens.~

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The time-of-flight (ToF) technique is an emerging technique for rapidly acquiring distance information and is becoming increasingly popular for intra-operative surface acquisition. Using the ToF technique as an intra-operative imaging modality requires seamless integration into the clinical workflow. We thus aim to integrate ToF support in an existing framework for medical image processing.
METHODS: MITK-ToF was implemented as an extension of the open-source C++ Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) and provides the basic functionality needed for rapid prototyping and development of image-guided therapy (IGT) applications that utilize range data for intra-operative surface acquisition. This framework was designed with a module-based architecture separating the hardware-dependent image acquisition task from the processing of the range data.
RESULTS: The first version of MITK-ToF has been released as an open-source toolkit and supports several ToF cameras and basic processing algorithms. The toolkit, a sample application, and a tutorial are available from http://mitk.org.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increased popularity of time-of-flight cameras for intra-operative surface acquisition, integration of range data supports into medical image processing toolkits such as MITK is a necessary step. Handling acquisition of range data from different cameras and processing of the data requires the establishment and use of software design principles that emphasize flexibility, extendibility, robustness, performance, and portability. The open-source toolkit MITK-ToF satisfies these requirements for the image-guided therapy community and was already used in several research projects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current software tools for electrophysiological experiments are limited in flexibility and rarely offer adequate support for advanced techniques such as dynamic clamp and hybrid experiments, which are therefore limited to laboratories with a significant expertise in neuroinformatics.
NEW METHOD: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface (CLI) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms.
RESULTS: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a CLI are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, RTXI and RELACS.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that lcg will greatly contribute to the standardization and reproducibility of both simple and complex experiments. Additionally, on the long run the increased efficiency due to a CLI will prove a great benefit for the experimental community.},

Automated tracking of animal movement is less labor-intensive and bias-prone than direct observation, and allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple animals, high spatial and temporal resolution, and data collection over extended periods of time. Here, we present a new video-tracking system built on Python-based software that is free, open source, and cross-platform, and that can analyze video input from widely available video capture devices such as smartphone cameras and webcams. We validated this software through four tests on a variety of animal species, including larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Siberian dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), and wild birds. These tests highlight the capacity of our software for long-term data acquisition, parallel analysis of multiple animals, and application to animal species of different sizes and movement patterns. We applied the software to an analysis of the effects of ethanol on thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behavior on adult zebrafish, and found that acute ethanol treatment decreased thigmotaxis behaviors without affecting overall amounts of motion. The open source nature of our software enables flexibility, customization, and scalability in behavioral analyses. Moreover, our system presents a free alternative to commercial video-tracking systems and is thus broadly applicable to a wide variety of educational settings and research programs.},

  shorttitle = {Scalable Decision Support at the Point of Care},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed medications is a serious health problem in the United States, costing an estimated \$100 billion per year. While poor adherence should be addressable with point of care health information technology, integrating new solutions with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems require customization within each organization, which is difficult because of the monolithic software design of most EHR products.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to create a published algorithm for predicting medication adherence problems easily accessible at the point of care through a Web application that runs on the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusuable Technologies (SMART) platform. The SMART platform is an emerging framework that enables EHR systems to behave as "iPhone like platforms" by exhibiting an application programming interface for easy addition and deletion of third party apps. The app is presented as a point of care solution to monitoring medication adherence as well as a sufficiently general, modular application that may serve as an example and template for other SMART apps.
METHODS: The widely used, open source Django framework was used together with the SMART platform to create the interoperable components of this app. Django uses Python as its core programming language. This allows statistical and mathematical modules to be created from a large array of Python numerical libraries and assembled together with the core app to create flexible and sophisticated EHR functionality. Algorithms that predict individual adherence are derived from a retrospective study of dispensed medication claims from a large private insurance plan. Patients' prescription fill information is accessed through the SMART framework and the embedded algorithms compute adherence information, including predicted adherence one year after the first prescription fill. Open source graphing software is used to display patient medication information and the results of statistical prediction of future adherence on a clinician-facing Web interface.
RESULTS: The user interface allows the physician to quickly review all medications in a patient record for potential non-adherence problems. A gap-check and current medication possession ratio (MPR) threshold test are applied to all medications in the record to test for current non-adherence. Predictions of 1-year non-adherence are made for certain drug classes for which external data was available. Information is presented graphically to indicate present non-adherence, or predicted non-adherence at one year, based on early prescription fulfillment patterns. The MPR Monitor app is installed in the SMART reference container as the "MPR Monitor", where it is publically available for use and testing. MPR is an acronym for Medication Possession Ratio, a commonly used measure of adherence to a prescribed medication regime. This app may be used as an example for creating additional functionality by replacing statistical and display algorithms with new code in a cycle of rapid prototyping and implementation or as a framework for a new SMART app.
CONCLUSIONS: The MPR Monitor app is a useful pilot project for monitoring medication adherence. It also provides an example that integrates several open source software components, including the Python-based Django Web framework and python-based graphics, to build a SMART app that allows complex decision support methods to be encapsulated to enhance EHR functionality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laser scanning microscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the structure and function of biological specimens. Although numerous commercial laser scanning microscopes exist, some of the more interesting and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition hardware and writing the complex software required to run the laser scanning microscope.
RESULTS: We describe a simple, software-based approach to operating a laser scanning microscope without the need for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control of laser scanning are achieved through standard data acquisition boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality.
CONCLUSIONS: We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible laser scanning microscope that allows easy custom design.},

  title = {Recording Human Electrocorticographic ({{ECoG}}) Signals for Neuroscientific Research and Real-Time Functional Cortical Mapping},
  issn = {1940-087X},
  doi = {10.3791/3993},
  abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., $<$1 cm/$<$1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an SDK that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of ECS mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by ECS. The results from our passive SIGFRIED mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human ECoG data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.},

Open-access scientific journals are a first step in this direction; a further step is to make auxiliary and supplementary materials that accompany scientific publications, such as methodological procedures and data-analysis tools, open and accessible to the scientific community. To this purpose it is instrumental to establish a software base, which will grow toward a comprehensive free and open-source language of technical and scientific computing. Endeavors in this direction are met with an important obstacle. MATLAB((R)), the predominant computation tool in many fields of research, is a closed-source commercial product. To facilitate the transition to an open computation platform, we propose Open-source MATLAB((R))-to-Python Compiler (OMPC), a platform that uses syntax adaptation and emulation to allow transparent import of existing MATLAB((R)) functions into Python programs. The imported MATLAB((R)) modules will run independently of MATLAB((R)), relying on Python's numerical and scientific libraries. Python offers a stable and mature open source platform that, in many respects, surpasses commonly used, expensive commercial closed source packages. The proposed software will therefore facilitate the transparent transition towards a free and general open-source lingua franca for scientific computation, while enabling access to the existing methods and algorithms of technical computing already available in MATLAB((R)).

While DV3D is primarily a visualization tool, the package allows an analysis approach where results from one imaging modality can guide comparative analysis of another modality in a single coordinate space. DV3D is built on Python, a dynamic object-oriented programming language with support for integration of modular toolkits, and development of cross-platform software for neuroimaging. DV3D harnesses the power of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rendering, calling VTK's low level C++ functions from Python. Users interact with data via an intuitive interface that uses Python to bind wxWidgets, which in turn calls the user's operating system dialogs and graphical user interface tools. DV3D currently supports NIfTI-1, ANALYZE and DICOM formats for MRI data display (including statistical data overlay). Formats for other data types are supported. The modularity of DV3D and ease of use of Python allows rapid integration of additional format support and user development. DV3D has been tested on Mac OSX, RedHat Linux and Microsoft Windows XP.

The system uses an Yb:KYW femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions. Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a LeCroy digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity, the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Our design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a tool for the study of neuronal activity.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A system architecture has been developed for integration of intraoperative 3D imaging [viz., mobile C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT)] with surgical navigation (e.g., trackers, endoscopy, and preoperative image and planning data). The goal of this paper is to describe the architecture and its handling of a broad variety of data sources in modular tool development for streamlined use of CBCT guidance in application-specific surgical scenarios.
METHODS: The architecture builds on two proven open-source software packages, namely the cisst package (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and 3D Slicer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), and combines data sources common to image-guided procedures with intraoperative 3D imaging. Integration at the software component level is achieved through language bindings to a scripting language (Python) and an object-oriented approach to abstract and simplify the use of devices with varying characteristics. The platform aims to minimize offline data processing and to expose quantitative tools that analyze and communicate factors of geometric precision online. Modular tools are defined to accomplish specific surgical tasks, demonstrated in three clinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) that involve a progressively increased level of complexity in toolset requirements.
RESULTS: The resulting architecture (referred to as "TREK") hosts a collection of modules developed according to application-specific surgical tasks, emphasizing streamlined integration with intraoperative CBCT. These include multi-modality image display; 3D-3D rigid and deformable registration to bring preoperative image and planning data to the most up-to-date CBCT; 3D-2D registration of planning and image data to real-time fluoroscopy; infrared, electromagnetic, and video-based trackers used individually or in hybrid arrangements; augmented overlay of image and planning data in endoscopic or in-room video; and real-time "virtual fluoroscopy" computed from GPU-accelerated digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Application in three preclinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) demonstrates the utility of the modular, task-specific approach in progressively complex tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: The design and development of a system architecture for image-guided surgery has been reported, demonstrating enhanced utilization of intraoperative CBCT in surgical applications with vastly different requirements. The system integrates C-arm CBCT with a broad variety of data sources in a modular fashion that streamlines the interface to application-specific tools, accommodates distinct workflow scenarios, and accelerates testing and translation of novel toolsets to clinical use. The modular architecture was shown to adapt to and satisfy the requirements of distinct surgical scenarios from a common code-base, leveraging software components arising from over a decade of effort within the imaging and computer-assisted interventions community.},

An ecosystem of free open-source software exists to fill these gaps, including thousands of analysis and plotting packages written in Python and R, which can be implemented in a sharable and reproducible format, such as the Jupyter electronic notebook. This tool chain can largely replace current routines by importing data, producing analyses, and generating publication-quality graphics. An electronic notebook like Jupyter allows these analyses, along with documentation of procedures, to display locally or remotely in an internet browser, which can be saved as an HTML, PDF, or other file format for sharing with team members and the scientific community. The present report illustrates these methods using data from electrophysiological recordings of the musk shrew vagus-a model system to investigate gut-brain communication, for example, in cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. We show methods for spike sorting (including statistical validation), spike train analysis, and analysis of compound action potentials in notebooks. Raw data and code are available from notebooks in data supplements or from an executable online version, which replicates all analyses without installing software-an implementation of reproducible research. This demonstrates the promise of combining disparate analyses into one platform, along with the ease of sharing this work.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, the availability of high-resolution microscopy together with the advancements in the development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in molecular cell biology. These techniques enable the investigation of cellular characteristics like volume, size and geometry as well as volume and geometry of intracellular compartments, and the amount of existing proteins in a spatially resolved manner. Such detailed investigations opened up many new areas of research in the study of spatial, complex and dynamic cellular systems. One of the crucial challenges for the study of such systems is the design of a well stuctured and optimized workflow to provide a systematic and efficient hypothesis verification. Computer Science can efficiently address this task by providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and evaluation of biological data to the benefit of experimenters and modelers.
RESULTS: The Spatio-Temporal Simulation Environment (STSE) is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on microscopy images. The framework contains modules to digitize, represent, analyze, and mathematically model spatial distributions of biochemical species. Graphical user interface (GUI) tools provided with the software enable meshing of the simulation space based on the Voronoi concept. In addition, it supports to automatically acquire spatial information to the mesh from the images based on pixel luminosity (e.g. corresponding to molecular levels from microscopy images). STSE is freely available either as a stand-alone version or included in the linux live distribution Systems Biology Operational Software (SB.OS) and can be downloaded from http://www.stse-software.org/. The Python source code as well as a comprehensive user manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research community. We discuss main concepts of the STSE design and workflow. We demonstrate it's usefulness using the example of a signaling cascade leading to formation of a morphological gradient of Fus3 within the cytoplasm of the mating yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
CONCLUSIONS: STSE is an efficient and powerful novel platform, designed for computational handling and evaluation of microscopic images. It allows for an uninterrupted workflow including digitization, representation, analysis, and mathematical modeling. By providing the means to relate the simulation to the image data it allows for systematic, image driven model validation or rejection. STSE can be scripted and extended using the Python language. STSE should be considered rather as an API together with workflow guidelines and a collection of GUI tools than a stand alone application. The priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive way of extending and customizing software using the Python language.},

  abstract = {An algorithmic information theoretic method is presented for object-level summarization of meaningful changes in image sequences. Object extraction and tracking data are represented as an attributed tracking graph (ATG), whose connected subgraphs are compared using an adaptive information distance measure, aided by a closed-form multi-dimensional quantization. The summary is the clustering result and feature subset that maximize the gap statistic. The notion of meaningful summarization is captured by using the gap statistic to estimate the randomness deficiency from algorithmic statistics. When applied to movies of cultured neural progenitor cells, it correctly distinguished neurons from progenitors without requiring the use of a fixative stain. When analyzing intra-cellular molecular transport in cultured neurons undergoing axon specification, it automatically confirmed the role of kinesins in axon specification. Finally, it was able to differentiate wild type from genetically modified thymocyte cells.},

  abstract = {Gephi is a network visualization software used in various disciplines (social network analysis, biology, genomics\ldots{}). One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

In the real world, a realistic setting for computer vision or multimedia recognition problems is that we have some classes containing lots of training data and many classes containing a small amount of training data. Therefore, how to use frequent classes to help learning rare classes for which it is harder to collect the training data is an open question. Learning with shared information is an emerging topic in machine learning, computer vision and multimedia analysis. There are different levels of components that can be shared during concept modeling and machine learning stages, such as sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, etc. Regarding the specific methods, multi-task learning, transfer learning and deep learning can be seen as using different strategies to share information. These learning with shared information methods are very effective in solving real-world large-scale problems.},

Our approach achieves on average 97.0\% linkage accuracy across all species and imaging modalities.

  abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature\textemdash{}an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981\textendash{}2004) and terrorism (1990\textendash{}2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Visual overviews that show temporal patterns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts. To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional layouts with multiple regions and user control of link visibility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature.},

  abstract = {In this technical demonstration, we showcase the MindFinder system \$-\$ a novel image search engine. Different from existing interactive image search engines, most of which only provide image-level relevance feedback, MindFinder enables users to sketch and tag query images at object level. By considering the image database as a huge repository, MindFinder is able to help users present and refine their initial thoughts in their mind, and finally turn thoughts to a beautiful image(s). Multiple actions are enabled for users to flexibly design their queries in a bilateral interactive manner by leveraging the whole image database, including tagging, refining query by dragging and dropping objects from search results, as well as editing objects. After each action, the search results will be updated in real time to provide users up-to-date materials to further formulate the query. By the deliberate but easy design of the query, MindFinder not only tries to enable users to present on the query panel whatever they are imagining, but also returns to users the most similar images to the picture in users' mind. By scaling up the image database to 10 million, MindFinder has the potential to reveal whatever in users' mind, that is where the name MindFinder comes from.},

Computations are represented by graphs whose nodes are data transformations and whose arcs are data paths. The system allows the user to build and edit graphs and attach attributes to graph nodes specifying details of the computation (gains, masks, et cetera). Once the graph is adequately connected, the system traverses the graph, analyzes the data dependencies, and constructs an execution schedule. It then repeatedly executes the schedule, mapping graph nodes to specific hardware resources as needed. We discuss the overall architecture of the system, describe the class of hardware devices to which it is applicable, and then present an implementation for the Datacube MV 20. We analyze the implementation in terms of how well it makes use of the underlying hardware, and discuss ways of improving its efficiency.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a general formulation for a minimum cost data association problem which associates data features via one-to-one, m-to-one and one-to-n links with minimum total cost of the links. A motivating example is a problem of tracking multiple interacting nanoparticles imaged on video frames, where particles can aggregate into one particle or a particle can be split into multiple particles. Many existing multitarget tracking methods are capable of tracking non-interacting targets or tracking interacting targets of restricted degrees of interactions. The proposed formulation solves a multitarget tracking problem for general degrees of inter-object interactions. The formulation is in the form of a binary integer programming problem. We propose a polynomial time solution approach that can obtain a good relaxation solution of the binary integer programming, so the approach can be applied for multitarget tracking problems of a moderate size (for hundreds of targets over tens of time frames). The resulting solution is always integral and obtains a better duality gap than the simple linear relaxation solution of the corresponding problem. The proposed method was validated through applications to simulated multitarget tracking problems and a real multitarget tracking problem.},

Due to occlusions by targets and static objects, noisy segmentation and false alarms, one foreground region may not correspond to one target faithfully. Therefore the one-to-one assumption used in most data association algorithm is not always satisfied. Our method overcomes the one-to-one assumption by formulating the visual tracking problem in terms of finding the best spatial and temporal association of observations, which maximizes the consistency of both motion and appearance of trajectories. To avoid enumerating all possible solutions, we take a Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) approach to sample the solution space efficiently. The sampling is driven by an informed proposal scheme controlled by a joint probability model combining motion and appearance. To make sure the Markov chain to converge to a desired distribution, we propose an automatic approach to determine the parameters in the target distribution. Comparative experiments with quantitative evaluations are provided.},

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity but implementations require suitable (normal) compression algorithms. We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image.

How robust is it to rotation, translation, and scaling? Which are the most adequate image formats and compression algorithms? The results of our study show that NCD can be used to address some of the selected image comparison problems, but care must be taken on the compressor and image format selected.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10219},
  abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of \$n\$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex \$S\_\{n-1\}\$, which is the set of all probability distributions over \$n\$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \$\{$\backslash$mathbf\{p\}\}\$ to distribution \$\{$\backslash$mathbf\{q\}\}\$, where \$\{$\backslash$mathbf\{p\}\}\$, \$\{$\backslash$mathbf\{q\}\} $\backslash$in S\_\{n-1\}\$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \$C(\{$\backslash$mathbf\{p\}\}, \{$\backslash$mathbf\{q\}\})\$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \$\{$\backslash$mathbf\{p\}\}=\{$\backslash$mathbf\{q\}\}\$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \$S\_\{n-1\} $\backslash$times S\_\{n-1\}\$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.},

  abstract = {Video stabilization is an important video enhancement technology which aims at removing annoying shaky motion from videos. We propose a practical and robust approach of video stabilization that produces full-frame stabilized videos with good visual quality. While most previous methods end up with producing smaller size stabilized videos, our completion method can produce full-frame videos by naturally filling in missing image parts by locally aligning image data of neighboring frames. To achieve this, motion inpainting is proposed to enforce spatial and temporal consistency of the completion in both static and dynamic image areas. In addition, image quality in the stabilized video is enhanced with a new practical deblurring algorithm. Instead of estimating point spread functions, our method transfers and interpolates sharper image pixels of neighboring frames to increase the sharpness of the frame. The proposed video completion and deblurring methods enabled us to develop a complete video stabilizer which can naturally keep the original image quality in the stabilized videos. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by extensive experiments over a wide variety of videos},

Our goal is to compute camera paths that are composed of constant, linear and parabolic segments mimicking the camera motions employed by professional cinematographers. To this end, our algorithm is based on a linear programming framework to minimize the first, second, and third derivatives of the resulting camera path. Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos. Our approach accomplishes this without the need of user interaction or costly 3D reconstruction of the scene, and works as a post-process for videos from any camera or from an online source.},

Previous work has demonstrated the compressibility of floating-point volume data, but such compression often comes with a tradeoff between computational complexity and the achievable compression ratio. This work demonstrates the use of special-purpose video encoding hardware on the GPU which is present but (to the best of our knowledge) completely unused in current GPU-equipped super computers such as Titan. We show that lossy encoding allows the output of far more data at sufficient quality for a posteriori rendering and analysis. We also show that the encoding can be computed in parallel to general-purpose computation due to the special-purpose hardware. Finally, we demonstrate such encoded volumes are inexpensive to decode in memory during analysis, making it unnecessary to ever store the decompressed volumes on disk.},

The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a~major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.},

We describe a reproducible and simple procedure for chronic through-bone wide-field imaging in awake head-fixed mice providing stable optical access for chronic imaging over large areas of the cortex for months. The preparation is produced by applying clear-drying dental cement to the intact mouse skull, followed by a glass coverslip to create a partially transparent imaging surface. Surgery time takes about 30min. A single set-screw provides a stable means of attachment (in relation to the measured lateral and axial resolution) for mesoscale assessment without obscuring the cortical field of view. We demonstrate the utility of this method by showing seed-pixel functional connectivity maps generated from spontaneous cortical activity of GCAMP6 signals in both awake and anesthetized mice in longitudinal studies of up to 2 months in duration. We propose that the intact skull preparation described here may be used for most longitudinal studies that do not require micron scale resolution and where cortical neural or vascular signals are recorded with intrinsic sensors or in transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded sensors of activity.},

We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in~vitro and in~vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.},

  abstract = {Implanted osmotic minipumps are commonly used for long-term, brain-targeted delivery of a wide range of experimental agents by being connected to a catheter and a cannula. During the stereotactical surgery procedure, the cannula has to be placed correctly in the x-y directions and also with respect to the injection point in the z-direction (deepness). However, the flat fixation base of available cannula holders doesn't allow an easy, secure fixation onto the curve-shaped skull. We have developed a modified method for a better fixation of the cannula holder by using an easy-to-produce, skull-shaped silicone spacer as fixation adapter. We describe the application and its fast and reliable production in the lab. Superglue or cement is currently being used as the method of choice. However, the curve-shaped skull surface does not fit well with the flat and rigid cannula adapter which leads to fixation problems over time causing wide infusion channels and often also to leakage problems from intracerebrally applied agents towards the surface meninges. As another consequence of the inappropriate fixation, the cannula may loosen from the skull before the end of the experiment or it causes damage to the brain tissue, harming the animals with leading to a failure of the whole experiment. The easy-to-produce spacer facilitates the crucial step of long-term, stereotactic brain infusion experiments with intracerebral catheters in a highly secure and reproducible way.},

Neuronal representations change as associations are learned between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is poorly understood whether representations for learned associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue to change following learning. We tracked the activity of posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between cells' activity and task features was mostly stable on single days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons informative about task features (trial type and maze locations) changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the population activity had statistically similar properties each day and stable information for over a week. As mice learned additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the neurons used for existing representations without greatly affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity for learning and stability for memory.},

  abstract = {The predominant focus in the neurobiological study of memory has been on remembering (persistence). However, recent studies have considered the neurobiology of forgetting (transience). Here we draw parallels between neurobiological and computational mechanisms underlying transience. We propose that it is the interaction between persistence and transience that allows for intelligent decision-making in dynamic, noisy environments. Specifically, we argue that transience (1) enhances flexibility, by reducing the influence of outdated information on memory-guided decision-making, and (2) prevents overfitting to specific past events, thereby promoting generalization. According to this view, the goal of memory is not the transmission of information through time, per se. Rather, the goal of memory is to optimize decision-making. As such, transience is as important as persistence in mnemonic systems.},

Subcellular resolution imaging of the whole brain and subsequent image analysis are prerequisites for understanding anatomical and functional brain networks. Here, we have developed a very high-speed serial-sectioning imaging system named FAST (block-face serial microscopy tomography), which acquires high-resolution images of a whole mouse brain in a speed range comparable to that of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. FAST enables complete visualization of the brain at a resolution sufficient to resolve all cells and their subcellular structures. FAST renders unbiased quantitative group comparisons of normal and disease model brain cells for the whole brain at a high spatial resolution. Furthermore, FAST is highly scalable to non-human primate brains and human postmortem brain tissues, and can visualize neuronal projections in a whole adult marmoset brain. Thus, FAST provides new opportunities for global approaches that will allow for a better understanding of brain systems in multiple animal models and in human diseases.},

The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a~major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.},

Neuronal stimulus selectivity is shaped by feedforward and recurrent excitatory-inhibitory interactions. In the auditory cortex (AC), parvalbumin- (PV) and~somatostatin-positive (SOM) inhibitory interneurons differentially modulate frequency-dependent responses of excitatory neurons. Responsiveness of neurons in the AC to sound is also dependent on stimulus history. We found that the inhibitory effects of SOMs and PVs diverged as a function of adaptation to temporal repetition of tones. Prior to adaptation, suppressing either SOM or PV inhibition drove both increases and decreases in excitatory spiking activity. After adaptation, suppressing SOM activity caused predominantly disinhibitory effects, whereas suppressing PV activity still evoked bi-directional changes. SOM, but not PV-driven inhibition, dynamically modulated frequency tuning with adaptation. Unlike PV-driven inhibition, SOM-driven inhibition elicited gain-like increases in frequency tuning reflective of adaptation. Our findings suggest that distinct cortical interneurons differentially shape tuning to sensory stimuli across the neuronal receptive field, altering frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons during adaptation.},

  abstract = {Summary
Ca2+ imaging techniques permit time-lapse recordings of neuronal activity from large populations over weeks. However, without identifying the same neurons across imaging sessions (cell registration), longitudinal analysis of the neural code is restricted to population-level statistics. Accurate cell registration becomes challenging with increased numbers of cells, sessions, and inter-session intervals. Current cell registration practices, whether manual or automatic, do not quantitatively evaluate registration accuracy, possibly leading to data misinterpretation. We developed a probabilistic method that automatically registers cells across multiple sessions and estimates the registration confidence for each registered cell. Using large-scale Ca2+ imaging data recorded over weeks from the hippocampus and cortex of freely behaving mice, we show that our method performs more accurate registration than previously used routines, yielding estimated error rates $<$5\%, and that the registration is scalable for many sessions. Thus, our method allows reliable longitudinal analysis of the same neurons over long time periods.},

  issn = {0098-5589},
  doi = {10.1109/TSE.2002.1000452},
  abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that there is an optimal size for software components. This means that components that are too small or too big will have a higher defect content (i.e., there is a U-shaped curve relating defect content to size). The U-shaped curve has become known as the "Goldilocks Conjecture." Recently, a cognitive theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon and it has been expanded to characterize object-oriented software. This conjecture has wide implications for software engineering practice. It suggests 1) that designers should deliberately strive to design classes that are of the optimal size, 2) that program decomposition is harmful, and 3) that there exists a maximum (threshold) class size that should not be exceeded to ensure fewer faults in the software. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate this conjecture for object-oriented systems. We first demonstrate that the claims of an optimal component/class size (1) above) and of smaller components/classes having a greater defect content (2) above) are due to a mathematical artifact in the analyses performed previously. We then empirically test the threshold effect claims of this conjecture (3) above). To our knowledge, the empirical test of size threshold effects for object-oriented systems has not been performed thus far. We performed an initial study with an industrial C++ system and repeated it twice on another C++ system and on a commercial Java application. Our results provide unambiguous evidence that there is no threshold effect of class size. We obtained the same result for three systems using four different size measures. These findings suggest that there is a simple continuous relationship between class size and faults, and that, optimal class size, smaller classes are better and threshold effects conjectures have no sound theoretical nor empirical basis},

  abstract = {The analysis of texture is an important subroutine in application areas as diverse as biology, medicine, robotics, and forensic science. While the last three decades have seen extensive research in algorithms to measure texture similarity, almost all existing methods require the careful setting of many parameters. There are many problems associated with a lot of parameters, the most obvious of which is that with many parameters to fit, it is very difficult to avoid overfitting. In this work, we propose to extend recent advances in Kolmogorov complexity-based similarity measures to texture matching problems. These Kolmogorov-based methods have been shown to be very useful in intrinsically discrete domains such as DNA, protein sequences, MIDI music, and natural languages; however, they are not well defined for real-valued data. To address this, we introduce a very simple idea, the Campana-Keogh (CK) video compression-based method for texture measures. These measures utilize video compressors to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity. Using the parameter-free CK method, we novely utilize lossy compression to create an efficient and robust parameter-lite texture similarity measure: the CK-1 distance measure. We demonstrate the utility of our measure with extensive empirical evaluations on real-world case studies drawn from nematology, arachnology, entomology, medicine, forensics, texture analysis benchmarks, and many other domains.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia. Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate.
RESULTS: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. We combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results.

Efforts to tackle this problem have been hampered by the scarcity of markers that can be used to predict cell division outcomes. Here we present a computational method, based on algorithmic information theory, to analyze dynamic features of living cells over time. Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether RPCs will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99\% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87\% accuracy. Our implementation can segment, track and generate predictions for 40 cells simultaneously on a standard computer at 5 min per frame. This method could be used to isolate cell populations with specific developmental potential, enabling previously impossible investigations.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0312044},
  abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

Here I describe a collaborative approach to extracting meaning from biological imaging data. The collaboration consists of teams of biologists and engineers working together. Custom computational tools are built to best exploit application-specific knowledge in order to visualize and analyze large and complex data sets. The image data are summarized, extracting and modeling the features that capture the objects and relationships in the data. The summarization is validated, the results visualized, and errors corrected as needed. Finally, the customized analysis and visualization tools together with the image data and the summarization results are shared. This Perspective provides a brief guide to the mathematical ideas that rigorously quantify the notion of extracting meaning from biological image, and to the practical approaches that have been used to apply these ideas to a wide range of applications in cell and tissue optical imaging.},

  abstract = {Background
A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson's Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson's disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data\textendash{}large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources\textendash{}all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data.

Methods and Findings
Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson's disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96\%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting.

Conclusions
Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson's disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80\%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.},

To achieve the full benefit of these tools requires improved optical systems with high light collection efficiency, high spatial and temporal resolution, and patterned optical stimulation, in a wide field of view (FOV). Here we describe our `Firefly' microscope, which achieves these goals in a \O{}6 mm FOV. The Firefly optical system is optimized for simultaneous photostimulation and fluorescence imaging in cultured cells. All but one of the optical elements are commercially available, yet the microscope achieves 10-fold higher light collection efficiency at its design magnification than the comparable commercially available microscope using the same objective. The Firefly microscope enables all-optical electrophysiology (`Optopatch') in cultured neurons with a throughput and information content unmatched by other neuronal phenotyping systems. This capability opens possibilities in disease modeling and phenotypic drug screening. We also demonstrate applications of the system to voltage and calcium recordings in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.},

The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences.

  shorttitle = {Deep {{Neuroevolution}}},
  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of techniques that have been developed in the neuroevolution community to improve performance on RL problems. To demonstrate the latter, we show that combining DNNs with novelty search, which was designed to encourage exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA parallelizes better than ES, A3C, and DQN, and enables a state-of-the-art compact encoding technique that can represent million-parameter DNNs in thousands of bytes.},

  abstract = {Light field cameras have many advantages over traditional cameras, as they allow the user to change various camera settings after capture. However, capturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern light field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current consumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames. Instead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video camera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence and a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field video at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed into two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The flow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field sequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The appearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final pixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current video interpolation methods, enabling consumer light field videography, and making applications such as refocusing and parallax view generation achievable on videos for the first time.},

Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.},

  abstract = {We present Calipso, an interactive method for editing images and videos in a physically-coherent manner. Our main idea is to realize physics-based manipulations by running a full physics simulation on proxy geometries given by non-rigidly aligned CAD models. Running these simulations allows us to apply new, unseen forces to move or deform selected objects, change physical parameters such as mass or elasticity, or even add entire new objects that interact with the rest of the underlying scene. In Calipso, the user makes edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then transfered to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a photo-realistic rendering process. To align the CAD models, we introduce an efficient CAD-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics. We demonstrate Calipso's physics-based editing on a wide range of examples producing myriad physical behavior while preserving geometric and visual consistency.},

The inherent closedloop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) hosted on Cloud data-centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we develop RIoTBench, a Realtime IoT Benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as reusable micro-benchmarks. Further, we propose four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks, and that leverage various dataflow semantics of DSPS. The applications are based on common IoT patterns for data pre-processing, statistical summarization and predictive analytics. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and fitness, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10000 messages/sec and diverse frequency distributions. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public Cloud, and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, and by IoT practitioners to evaluate DSPS platforms.},

  abstract = {Moving object segmentation in videos has always been a challenging task in the presence of large camera movements. Moreover, when the camera motion is jittery, most of the existing motion segmentation approaches fail. In this work, we propose an optimization framework for the segmentation of moving object in jittery videos. A novel Optical Trajectory Descriptor Matrix (OTDM) built on point trajectories has been proposed for this purpose. An optimization function has been formulated for stabilizing the trajectories, followed by spectral clustering of the proposed latent trajectories. Latent trajectories are obtained by performing Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) on the OTDM (factorization of OTDM using KL divergence). This integrated framework yields accurate clustering of the trajectories from jittery videos. Foreground pixel labelling is obtained by utilizing the clustered trajectory coordinates for modelling the foreground and background, using a GraphCut based energy formulation. Experiments were performed on 16 real-world jittery videos. Also, the results have been generated for a standard segmentation dataset, SegTrackv2, with synthetic jitter incorporated. Jitter extracted from a real video is inserted into stable SegTrackv2 videos for analysis of performance. The proposed method, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, was found to be superior.},

  abstract = {For large-scale graph analytics on the GPU, the irregularity of data access and control flow, and the complexity of programming GPUs, have presented two significant challenges to developing a programmable high-performance graph library. ``Gunrock,'' our graph-processing system designed specifically for the GPU, uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We characterize the performance of various optimization strategies and evaluate Gunrock's overall performance on different GPU architectures on a wide range of graph primitives that span from traversal-based algorithms and ranking algorithms, to triangle counting and bipartite-graph-based algorithms. The results show that on a single GPU, Gunrock has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and CPU shared-memory graph libraries, such as Ligra and Galois, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.},

I test the computational framework on the salamander retinal data and the cortical spiking data of behaving rats. For the retinal data, the original form of population coupling and its advanced form can explain a significant fraction of two-cell correlations and three-cell correlations, respectively. For the cortical data, the performance becomes much better, and the second order population coupling reveals non-local effects in local cortical circuits.},

  abstract = {In order to understand how populations of neurons encode information about external correlates, it is important to develop minimal models of the probability of neural population responses which capture all the salient changes of neural responses with stimuli. In this context, it is particularly useful to determine whether interactions among neurons responding to stimuli can be described by a pairwise interaction model, or whether a higher order interaction model is needed. To address this question, we compared real neural population activity obtained from the rat somatosensory cortex to maximum-entropy models which take into account only interaction of up any given order. By performing these comparisons, we found that interactions of order two were sufficient to explain a large amount of observed stimulus-response distributions, but not all of them. Triple-wise interactions were necessary to fully explain the data. We then used Shannon information to compute the impact of high order correlations on the amount of somatosensory information transmitted by the neural population. We found that correlations of order two gave a good approximation of information carried by the neural population, within 4\% of the true value. Third order correlations gave an even better approximation, within 2\% of the true value. Taken together, these results suggest that higher order interactions exist and shape the dynamics of cortical networks, but play a quantitatively minor role in determining the information capacity of neural populations.},

In this study, we compare the abilities of two vectorizing procedures (multineuronal and time-segmental) to extract information from spike trains during the same total neuron-seconds. In the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, we defined a response vector whose components represented the spike counts of one to five neurons. In the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, a response vector consisted of components representing a neuron's spike counts for one to five time-segment(s) of a response period of 1 s. Spike trains were recorded from neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys presented with visual stimuli. We examined whether the amount of information of the visual stimuli carried by these neurons differed between the two vectorizing procedures. The amount of information calculated with the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, but not the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, significantly increased with the dimensions of the response vector. We conclude that the multineuronal vectorizing procedure is superior to the time-segmental vectorizing procedure in efficiently extracting information from neuronal signals.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the genuine and random synchronization indexes in multivariate neural series, denoted as GSI (genuine synchronization index) and RSI (random synchronization index), by means of a correlation matrix analysis and surrogate technique. The performance of the method is evaluated by using a multi-channel neural mass model (MNMM), including the effects of different coupling coefficients, signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and time-window widths on the estimation of the GSI and RSI. Results show that the GSI and the RSI are superior in description of the synchronization in multivariate neural series compared to the S-estimator. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to analyze a 21-channel scalp electroencephalographic recording of a 35~year-old male who suffers from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The GSI and the RSI at different frequency bands during the epileptic seizure are estimated. The present results could be helpful for us to understand the synchronization mechanism of epileptic seizures.},

In fact, many of the available open-source toolboxes still lack two fundamental requirements for treating multi-channel recordings: (i) a rich repertoire of algorithms for extracting information both at a single channel and at the whole network level; (ii) the capability of autonomously repeating the same set of computational operations to `multiple' recording streams (also from different experiments) and without a manual intervention.

However, such virtual slides build up a technical challenge since the images occupy often several gigabytes and cannot be fully opened in a computer's memory. Moreover, there is no standard format. Therefore, most common open source tools such as ImageJ fail at treating them, and the others require expensive hardware while still being prohibitively slow.
RESULTS: We have developed several cross-platform open source software tools to overcome these limitations. The NDPITools provide a way to transform microscopy images initially in the loosely supported NDPI format into one or several standard TIFF files, and to create mosaics (division of huge images into small ones, with or without overlap) in various TIFF and JPEG formats. They can be driven through ImageJ plugins. The LargeTIFFTools achieve similar functionality for huge TIFF images which do not fit into RAM. We test the performance of these tools on several digital slides and compare them, when applicable, to standard software. A statistical study of the cells in a tissue sample from an oligodendroglioma was performed on an average laptop computer to demonstrate the efficiency of the tools.
CONCLUSIONS: Our open source software enables dealing with huge images with standard software on average computers. They are cross-platform, independent of proprietary libraries and very modular, allowing them to be used in other open source projects. They have excellent performance in terms of execution speed and RAM requirements. They open promising perspectives both to the clinician who wants to study a single slide and to the research team or data centre who do image analysis of many slides on a computer cluster.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video cameras sense passively from a distance, offer a rich information stream, and provide intuitively meaningful raw data. Camera-based imaging has thus proven critical for many advances in neuroscience and biology, with applications ranging from cellular imaging of fluorescent dyes to tracking of whole-animal behavior at ecologically relevant spatial scales.
RESULTS: Here we present 'Motmot': an open-source software suite for acquiring, displaying, saving, and analyzing digital video in real-time. At the highest level, Motmot is written in the Python computer language. The large amounts of data produced by digital cameras are handled by low-level, optimized functions, usually written in C. This high-level/low-level partitioning and use of select external libraries allow Motmot, with only modest complexity, to perform well as a core technology for many high-performance imaging tasks. In its current form, Motmot allows for: (1) image acquisition from a variety of camera interfaces (package motmot.cam\_iface), (2) the display of these images with minimal latency and computer resources using wxPython and OpenGL (package motmot.wxglvideo), (3) saving images with no compression in a single-pass, low-CPU-use format (package motmot.FlyMovieFormat), (4) a pluggable framework for custom analysis of images in realtime and (5) firmware for an inexpensive USB device to synchronize image acquisition across multiple cameras, with analog input, or with other hardware devices (package motmot.fview\_ext\_trig). These capabilities are brought together in a graphical user interface, called 'FView', allowing an end user to easily view and save digital video without writing any code. One plugin for FView, 'FlyTrax', which tracks the movement of fruit flies in real-time, is included with Motmot, and is described to illustrate the capabilities of FView.
CONCLUSION: Motmot enables realtime image processing and display using the Python computer language. In addition to the provided complete applications, the architecture allows the user to write relatively simple plugins, which can accomplish a variety of computer vision tasks and be integrated within larger software systems. The software is available at http://code.astraw.com/projects/motmot.},

Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged fields into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with flexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages.

The system corrects for rolling-shutter distortions using measurements from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, and a 3D rotational distortion model.

The accuracy of the orientation estimates has been evaluated experimentally using ground truth data from a motion capture system. We have conducted a user study, where the output from our system, implemented in iOS, has been compared to that of three other applications, as well as to the uncorrected video.

Here we show the efficacy of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic neural cell grafting in the brain, which is considered a less immune-responsive tissue, using iPSCs derived from an MHC homozygous cynomolgus macaque. Positron emission tomography imaging reveals neuroinflammation associated with an immune response against MHC-mismatched grafted cells. Immunohistological analyses reveal that MHC-matching reduces the immune response by suppressing the accumulation of microglia (Iba-1+) and lymphocytes (CD45+) into the grafts. Consequently, MHC-matching increases the survival of grafted dopamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase: TH+). The effect of an immunosuppressant, Tacrolimus, is also confirmed in the same experimental setting. Our results demonstrate the rationale for MHC-matching in neural cell grafting to the brain and its feasibility in a clinical setting. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matching improves graft survival rates after organ transplantation. Here the authors show that in macaques, MHC-matched iPSC-derived neurons provide better engraftment in the brain, with a lower immune response and higher survival of the transplanted neurons.},

However, long-term analysis of human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum; this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from patients with PD or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate marker CORIN did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate model indicates that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with PD.},

  abstract = {Summary
Neurons transmit information to distant brain regions via long-range axonal projections. In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which~obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences (``barcodes''). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area is dissected, and the~barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits.},

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike---a feat that arguably no other image analysis package, commercial or open source, has yet achieved. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical sciences, making ImageJ an invaluable resource across countless disciplines. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework adaptable to future needs, enabling continued success and innovation.},

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3795-04.2004},
  abstract = {The functions of synapsins were examined by characterizing the phenotype of mice in which all three synapsin genes were knocked out. Although these triple knock-out mice were viable and had normal brain anatomy, they exhibited a number of behavioral defects. Synaptic transmission was altered in cultured neurons from the hippocampus of knock-out mice. At excitatory synapses, loss of synapsins did not affect basal transmission evoked by single stimuli but caused a threefold increase in the rate of synaptic depression during trains of stimuli. This suggests that synapsins regulate the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles. This possibility was examined further by measuring synaptic vesicle density in living neurons transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged synaptobrevin 2, a marker of synaptic vesicles. The relative amount of fluorescent synaptobrevin was substantially lower at synapses of knock-out neurons than of wild-type neurons. Electron microscopy also revealed a parallel reduction in the number of vesicles in the reserve pool of vesicles $>$150 nm away from the active zone at excitatory synapses. Thus, synapsins are required for maintaining vesicles in the reserve pool at excitatory synapses. In contrast, basal transmission at inhibitory synapses was reduced by loss of synapsins, but the kinetics of synaptic depression were unaffected. In these terminals, there was a mild reduction in the total number of synaptic vesicles, but this was not restricted to the reserve pool of vesicles. Thus, synapsins maintain the reserve pool of glutamatergic vesicles but regulate the size of the readily releasable pool of GABAergic vesicles.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that the synapsins play a broad role during neuronal development. They participate in the formation and maintenance of synaptic contacts among central neurons. In addition, each synapsin has a specific role during the elongation of undifferentiated processes and their posterior differentiation into axons and dendrites. In this review, we focus on these novel roles of synapsins during the early stages of development.},

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer~between these two components transduces voltage changes into fluorescence changes, providing a signal for imaging electrical activity in genetically targeted cells. To improve hVoS signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting motifs, and linkages of fluorescent proteins to optimize the normalized fluorescence change ($\Delta$F/F) and signal/noise ratio. The best results were obtained with cerulean fluorescent protein tagged N-terminally with a GAP43 motif and C-terminally with a truncated h-ras motif. With 100 mV steps in PC12 cells, this probe produced $\Delta$F/F = 26\% (4 $\mu$M dipicrylamine), which was threefold greater than that obtained with the original farnesylated EGFP construct. We also obtained a fivefold greater signal/noise ratio, which was 70\% of a theoretical optimum. We designate this GAP43-CerFP-t-h-ras construct as hVoS 2.0. With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that hVoS 2.0 places its fluorophore $\sim$40 \AA{} from the bilayer midplane. hVoS 2.0 performed well in cultured hippocampal neurons, where single action potentials produced clear fluorescence changes in a single trial. This improved probe should help investigators image voltage in genetically targeted neurons.},

They expand the possibilities of noninvasive analysis and have many useful properties, making them potential candidates for numerous novel applications. Notably, they have been shown that they can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are capable of conjugation with various cell types, including stem cells. In-depth research has been undertaken to establish these benefits, so that a deeper level of understanding of stem cell migratory pathways and differentiation, tumor migration, and improved drug delivery can be achieved. Stem cells have the ability to treat and cure many debilitating diseases with limited side effects, but a main problem that arises is in the noninvasive tracking and analysis of these stem cells. Recently, researchers have acknowledged the use of SPIONs for this purpose and have set out to establish suitable protocols for coating and attachment, so as to bring MRI tracking of SPION-labeled stem cells into common practice. This review paper explains the manner in which SPIONs are produced, conjugated, and tracked using MRI, as well as a discussion on their limitations. A concise summary of recently researched magnetic particle coatings is provided, and the effects of SPIONs on stem cells are evaluated, while animal and human studies investigating the role of SPIONs in stem cell tracking will be explored.Keywords: stem cells, nanoparticle, magnetic},

IFPs express well in mammalian cells and mice and spontaneously incorporate biliverdin, which is ubiquitous as the initial intermediate in heme catabolism but has negligible fluorescence by itself. Because their wavelengths penetrate tissue well, IFPs are suitable for whole-body imaging. The IFPs developed here provide a scaffold for further engineering.},

Simultaneous optical imaging in two bands is enabled by a dichroic beam splitter centered at 567 nm, with Sloan u' and g' bands available on the blue arm and Sloan r', i' and z\_s' bands available on the red arm. Additional narrow-band filters will also become available as required. An Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) detector is employed for both optical channels, each capable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under multiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000 fps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. CHIMERA was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).},

Using light, we are able to visualize the hemodynamic behavior of the brain to better understand neurovascular coupling and cerebral metabolism. In vivo optical imaging of tissue using endogenous chromophores necessitates spectroscopic detection to ensure molecular specificity as well as sufficiently high imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio, to allow dynamic physiological changes to be captured, isolated, and used as surrogate of pathophysiological processes. An optical imaging system is introduced using a 16-bands on-chip hyperspectral camera. Using this system, we show that up to three dyes can be imaged and quantified in a tissue phantom at video-rate through the optics of a surgical microscope. In vivo human patient data are presented demonstrating brain hemodynamic response can be measured intraoperatively with molecular specificity at high speed.},

The Fourier ptychography technique in reflection mode has great potential applications in tissue imaging and optical inspection, but the current configuration either has a limitation on cut-off frequency or is not practical. By placing the imaging aperture stop outside the illumination path, the illumination numerical aperture (NA) can be greater than the imaging NA of the objective lens. Thus, the cut-off frequency achieved in the proposed optical system is greater than twice the objective's NA divided by the wavelength (2NAobj/$\lambda$), which is the diffraction limit for the cut-off frequency in an incoherent epi-illumination configuration. We experimentally demonstrated that the synthesized NA is increased by a factor of 4.5 using the proposed optical concept. The key advantage of the proposed system is that it can achieve high-resolution imaging over a large field of view with a simple objective. It will have a great potential for applications in endoscopy, biomedical imaging, surface metrology, and industrial inspection.},

To this end we present a three-camera imaging microscope for fast tracking of multiple interacting molecules simultaneously, with high spatiotemporal resolution. The system was designed around an ASI RAMM frame using three separate tube lenses and custom multi-band dichroics to allow for enhanced detection efficiency. The frame times of the three Andor iXon Ultra EMCCD cameras are hardware synchronized to the laser excitation pulses of the three excitation lasers, such that the fluorophores are effectively immobilized during frame acquisitions and do not yield detections that are motion-blurred. Stroboscopic illumination allows robust detection from even rapidly moving molecules while minimizing bleaching, and since snapshots can be spaced out with varying time intervals, stroboscopic illumination enables a direct comparison to be made between fast and slow molecules under identical light dosage. We have developed algorithms that accurately track and co-localize multiple interacting biomolecules. The three-color microscope combined with our co-movement algorithms have made it possible for instance to simultaneously image and track how the chromosome environment affects diffusion kinetics or determine how mRNAs diffuse during translation. Such multiplexed single-molecule measurements at a high spatiotemporal resolution inside living cells will provide a major tool for testing models relating molecular architecture and biological dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescent confocal microscopy and voltage-sensitive and Ca2+ dyes have vastly improved our ability to image neuronal circuits. However, existing confocal systems are not fast enough or too noisy for many live-cell functional imaging studies. Here, we describe and demonstrate the function of a novel, nonscanning confocal microscopy module. The optics, which are designed to fit the standard camera port of the Olympus BX51WI epifluorescent microscope, achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high temporal resolution, making this configuration ideal for functional imaging of neuronal activities such as the voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging. The optics employ fixed 100- \texttimes{} 100-pinhole arrays at the back focal plane (optical conjugation plane), above the tube lens of a usual upright microscope. The excitation light travels through these pinholes, and the fluorescence signal, emitted from subject, passes through corresponding pinholes before exciting the photodiodes of the imager: a 100- \texttimes{} 100-pixel metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS)-type pixel imager with each pixel corresponding to a single 100- \texttimes{} 100-$\mu$m photodiode. This design eliminated the need for a scanning device; therefore, acquisition rate of the imager (maximum rate of 10 kHz) is the only factor limiting acquisition speed. We tested the application of the system for VSD and Ca2+ imaging of evoked neuronal responses on electrical stimuli in rat hippocampal slices. The results indicate that, at least for these applications, the new microscope maintains a high SNR at image acquisition rates of $\leq$0.3 ms per frame.},

  abstract = {In vivo oxygen measurement is the key to understanding how biological systems dynamically adapt to reductions in oxygen supply. High spatial resolution oxygen imaging is of particular importance because recent studies address the significance of within-tissue and within-cell heterogeneities in oxygen concentration in health and disease. Here, we report a new technique for in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs using green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-expressing COS-7 cells were briefly photoactivated with a strong blue light while lowering the oxygen concentration from 10\% to $<$0.001\%. Red fluorescence (excitation 520\textendash{}550 nm, emission $>$580 nm) appeared after photoactivation at $<$2\% oxygen (the red shift of GFP fluorescence). The red shift disappeared after reoxygenation of the cell, indicating that the red shift is stable as long as the cell is hypoxic. The red shift of GFP fluorescence was also demonstrated in single cardiomyocytes isolated from the GFP knock-in mouse (green mouse) heart. Then, we tried in vivo molecular imaging of hypoxia in organs. The red shift could be imaged in the ischemic liver and kidney in the green mouse using macroscopic optics provided that oxygen diffusion from the atmospheric air was prevented. In crystalloid-perfused beating heart isolated from the green mouse, significant spatial heterogeneities in the red shift were demonstrated in the epicardium distal to the coronary artery ligation. We conclude that the present technique using GFP as an oxygen indicator may allow in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs.},

We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in~vitro and in~vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.},

The pipeline system for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) is a flexible framework for the implementation of pipelines in the form of Octave or Matlab scripts. PSOM does not introduce new language constructs to specify the steps and structure of the workflow. All steps of analysis are instead described by a regular Matlab data structure, documenting their associated command and options, as well as their input, output and cleaned-up files. The PSOM execution engine provides a number of automated services: (1) it executes jobs in parallel on a local computing facility as long as the dependencies between jobs allow for it and sufficient resources are available; (2) it generates a comprehensive record of the pipeline stages and the history of execution, which is detailed enough to fully reproduce the analysis; (3) if an analysis is started multiple times, it executes only the parts of the pipeline that need to be reprocessed. PSOM is distributed under an opensource MIT license and can be used without restriction for academic or commercial projects. The package has no external dependencies besides Matlab or Octave, is straightforward to install and supports of variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac). We ran several benchmark experiments on a public database including 200 subjects, using a pipeline for the preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images. The benchmark results showed that PSOM is a powerful solution for the analysis of large databases using local or distributed computing resources.},

  shorttitle = {Automatic Analysis (Aa)},
  abstract = {Recent years have seen neuroimaging data becoming richer, with larger cohorts of participants, a greater variety of acquisition techniques, and increasingly complex analyses. These advances have made data analysis pipelines complex to set up and run (increasing the risk of human error) and time consuming to execute (restricting what analyses are attempted). Here we present an open-source framework, automatic analysis (aa), to address these concerns. Human efficiency is increased by making code modular and reusable, and managing its execution with a processing engine that tracks what has been completed and what needs to be (re)done. Analysis is accelerated by optional parallel processing of independent tasks on cluster or cloud computing resources. A pipeline comprises a series of modules that each perform a specific task. The processing engine keeps track of the data, calculating a map of upstream and downstream dependencies for each module.

Its temporal and spatial specificity, combined with efficacy in manipulating neuronal activity, are especially useful in studying the behavior of awake behaving animals. Conventional optogenetics, however, requires the use of lasers and optic fibers, which can place considerable restrictions on behavior. Here we combined a wirelessly controlled interface and small implantable light-emitting diode (LED) that allows flexible and precise placement of light source to illuminate any brain area. We tested this wireless LED system in vivo, in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in striatonigral neurons expressing D1-like dopamine receptors. In all mice tested, we were able to elicit movements reliably. The frequency of twitches induced by high power stimulation is proportional to the frequency of stimulation. At lower power, contraversive turning was observed. Moreover, the implanted LED remains effective over 50 days after surgery, demonstrating the long-term stability of the light source. Our results show that the wireless LED system can be used to manipulate neural activity chronically in behaving mice without impeding natural movements.},

TDT is written in Matlab and equipped with an interface to the widely used brain data analysis package SPM. The toolbox allows running fast whole-brain analyses, region-of-interest analyses and searchlight analyses, using machine learning classifiers, pattern correlation analysis, or representational similarity analysis. It offers automatic creation and visualization of diverse cross-validation schemes, feature scaling, nested parameter selection, a variety of feature selection methods, multiclass capabilities, and pattern reconstruction from classifier weights. While basic users can implement a generic analysis in one line of code, advanced users can extend the toolbox to their needs or exploit the structure to combine it with external high-performance classification toolboxes. The toolbox comes with an example data set which can be used to try out the various analysis methods. Taken together, TDT offers a promising option for researchers who want to employ multivariate analyses of brain activity patterns.},

To further our understanding of those processes there is a need to scrutinize dynamical signaling events and their functions in both cells and organisms. Here, we report a method and provide MATLAB code that analyzes time-lapse microscopy recordings to identify and characterize network structures within large cell populations, such as interconnected neurons. The approach is demonstrated using intracellular calcium (Ca2+) recordings in neural progenitors and cardiac myocytes, but could be applied to a wide variety of biosensors employed in diverse cell types and organisms. In this method, network structures are analyzed by applying cross-correlation signal processing and graph theory to single-cell recordings. The goal of the analysis is to determine if the single cell activity constitutes a network of interconnected cells and to decipher the properties of this network. The method can be applied in many fields of biology in which biosensors are used to monitor signaling events in living cells. Analyzing intercellular communication in cell ensembles can reveal essential network structures that provide important biological insights.},

  abstract = {Bio-inspired asynchronous event-based vision sensors are currently introducing a paradigm shift in visual information processing. These new sensors rely on a stimulus-driven principle of light acquisition similar to biological retinas. They are event-driven and fully asynchronous, thereby reducing redundancy and encoding exact times of input signal changes, leading to a very precise temporal resolution. Approaches for higher-level computer vision often rely on the realiable detection of features in visual frames, but similar definitions of features for the novel dynamic and event-based visual input representation of silicon retinas have so far been lacking. This article addresses the problem of learning and recognizing features for event-based vision sensors, which capture properties of truly spatiotemporal volumes of sparse visual event information. A novel computational architecture for learning and encoding spatiotemporal features is introduced based on a set of predictive recurrent reservoir networks, competing via winner-take-all selection. Features are learned in an unsupervised manner from real-world input recorded with event-based vision sensors. It is shown that the networks in the architecture learn distinct and task-specific dynamic visual features, and can predict their trajectories over time.},

These advances have made data analysis pipelines complex to set up and run (increasing the risk of human error) and time consuming to execute (restricting what analyses are attempted). Here we present an open-source framework, automatic analysis (aa), to address these concerns. Human efficiency is increased by making code modular and reusable, and managing its execution with a processing engine that tracks what has been completed and what needs to be (re)done. Analysis is accelerated by optional parallel processing of independent tasks on cluster or cloud computing resources. A pipeline comprises a series of modules that each perform a specific task. The processing engine keeps track of the data, calculating a map of upstream and downstream dependencies for each module. Existing modules are available for many analysis tasks, such as SPM-based fMRI preprocessing, individual and group level statistics, voxel-based morphometry, tractography, and multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA).

Tools and infrastructure are continuously being developed and deployed to facilitate research in this context: grid computation platforms to process the data, distributed data stores to house and share them, high-speed networks to move them around and collaborative, often web-based, platforms to provide access to and sometimes manage the entire system. BrainBrowser is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript visualization library built to provide easy-to-use, powerful, on-demand visualization of remote datasets in this new research environment. BrainBrowser leverages modern Web technologies, such as WebGL, HTML5 and Web Workers, to visualize 3D surface and volumetric neuroimaging data in any modern web browser without requiring any browser plugins. It is thus trivial to integrate BrainBrowser into any web-based platform. BrainBrowser is simple enough to produce a basic web-based visualization in a few lines of code, while at the same time being robust enough to create full-featured visualization applications. BrainBrowser can dynamically load the data required for a given visualization, so no network bandwidth needs to be waisted on data that will not be used. BrainBrowser's integration into the standardized web platform also allows users to consider using 3D data visualization in novel ways, such as for data distribution, data sharing and dynamic online publications. BrainBrowser is already being used in two major online platforms, CBRAIN and LORIS, and has been used to make the 1TB MACACC dataset openly accessible.},

  abstract = {Experiments to monitor human brain activity during active behavior record a variety of modalities (e.g., EEG, eye tracking, motion capture, respiration monitoring) and capture a complex environmental context leading to large, event-rich time series datasets. The considerable variability of responses within and among subjects in more realistic behavioral scenarios requires experiments to assess many more subjects over longer periods of time. This explosion of data requires better computational infrastructure to more systematically explore and process these collections. MOBBED is a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible toolkit that allows users to incorporate a computational database into their normal MATLAB workflow. Although capable of storing quite general types of annotated data, MOBBED is particularly oriented to multichannel time series such as EEG that have event streams overlaid with sensor data. MOBBED directly supports access to individual events, data frames and time-stamped feature vectors, allowing users to ask questions such as what types of events or features co-occur under various experimental conditions. A database provides several advantages not available to users who process one dataset at a time from the local file system. In addition to archiving primary data in a central place to save space and avoid inconsistencies, such a database allows users to manage, search, and retrieve events across multiple datasets without reading the entire dataset. The database also provides infrastructure for handling more complex event patterns that include environmental and contextual conditions. The database can also be used as a cache for expensive intermediate results that are reused in such activities as cross-validation of machine learning algorithms. MOBBED is implemented over PostgreSQL, a widely used open source database, and is freely available under the GNU general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/mobbed.},

  abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal responses is an increasingly accessible technology for probing population responses in cortex at single cell resolution, and with reasonable and improving temporal resolution. However, analysis of two-photon data is usually performed using ad-hoc solutions. To date, no publicly available software exists for straightforward analysis of stimulus-triggered two-photon imaging experiments. In addition, the increasing data rates of two-photon acquisition systems imply increasing cost of computing hardware required for in-memory analysis. Here we present a Matlab toolbox, "FocusStack", for simple and efficient analysis of two-photon calcium imaging stacks on consumer-level hardware, with minimal memory footprint. We also present a Matlab toolbox, "StimServer", for generation and sequencing of visual stimuli, designed to be triggered over a network link from a two-photon acquisition system. "FocusStack" is compatible out of the box with several existing two-photon acquisition systems, and is simple to adapt to arbitrary binary file formats. Analysis tools such as stack alignment for movement correction, automated cell detection and peri-stimulus time histograms are already provided, and further tools can be easily incorporated. Both packages are available as publicly-accessible source-code repositories.},

  abstract = {Intravital microscopy such as in vivo imaging of brain dynamics is often performed with custom-built microscope setups controlled by custom-written software to meet specific requirements. Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW, as a platform serving this dual role. HelioScan is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, HelioScan provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of HelioScan by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend HelioScan as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

This imaging head consists of two conical mirrors, which considerably reduce multiple back reflections between the animal and mirror surfaces. These back reflections are common in existing mirror-based imaging heads and tend to degrade the quality of raw measurement data. In addition, the introduction of a novel ray-transfer operator allows for the inclusion of the angular dependent data in the image reconstruction process, which results in higher image resolution. We describe in detail the system design and implementation of the hardware components as well as the transport-theory-based image reconstruction algorithm. Using numerical simulations, measurements on a well-defined phantom and a live animal, we evaluate the system performance and show the advantages of our approach.},

The preparation consisting of a head-fixed mouse on a spherical or cylindrical treadmill offers unique advantages in a variety of experimental contexts. Head fixation provides the mechanical stability necessary for optical and electrophysiological recordings and stimulation. Additionally, it can be combined with virtual environments such as T-mazes, enabling these types of recording during diverse behaviors.
New method
In this paper we present a low-cost, easy-to-build acquisition system, along with scalable computational methods to quantitatively measure behavior (locomotion and paws, whiskers, and tail motion patterns) in head-fixed mice locomoting on cylindrical or spherical treadmills.
Existing methods
Several custom supervised and unsupervised methods have been developed for measuring behavior in mice. However, to date there is no low-cost, turn-key, general-purpose, and scalable system for acquiring and quantifying behavior in mice.
Results
We benchmark our algorithms against ground truth data generated either by manual labeling or by simpler methods of feature extraction. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve good performance, both in supervised and unsupervised settings.
Conclusions
We present a low-cost suite of tools for behavioral quantification, which serve as valuable complements to recording and stimulation technologies being developed for the head-fixed mouse preparation.},

In~vivo calcium imaging using a 1-photon-based miniscope and a microendoscopic lens enables studies of neural activities in freely behaving animals. However, the high and fluctuating background, the inevitable movements and distortions of imaging field, and the extensive spatial overlaps of fluorescent signals emitted from imaged neurons inherent in this 1-photon imaging method present major challenges for extracting neuronal signals reliably and automatically from the raw imaging data. Here, we develop a unifying algorithm called the miniscope 1-photon imaging pipeline (MIN1PIPE), which contains several stand-alone modules and can handle a wide range of imaging conditions and qualities with minimal parameter tuning and automatically and accurately isolate spatially localized neural signals. We have quantitatively compared MIN1PIPE with other existing partial methods using both synthetic and real datasets obtained from different animal models and show that MIN1PIPE has superior efficiency and precision in analyzing noisy miniscope calcium imaging data.},

  abstract = {In vivo wide-field imaging of neural activity with a high spatio-temporal resolution is a challenge in modern neuroscience. Although two-photon imaging is very powerful, high-speed imaging of the activity of individual synapses is mostly limited to a field of approximately 200\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m on a side. Wide-field one-photon epifluorescence imaging can reveal neuronal activity over a field of $\geq$1\,mm2 at a high speed, but is not able to resolve a single synapse. Here, to achieve a high spatio-temporal resolution, we combine an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera with spinning-disk one-photon confocal microscopy. This combination allowed us to image a 1 mm2 field with a pixel resolution of 0.21\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m at 60 fps. When we imaged motor cortical layer 1 in a behaving head-restrained mouse, calcium transients were detected in presynaptic boutons of thalamocortical axons sparsely labeled with GCaMP6s, although their density was lower than when two-photon imaging was used. The effects of out-of-focus fluorescence changes on calcium transients in individual boutons appeared minimal. Axonal boutons with highly correlated activity were detected over the 1\,mm2 field, and were probably distributed on multiple axonal arbors originating from the same thalamic neuron. This new microscopy with an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera should serve to clarify the activity and plasticity of widely distributed cortical synapses.},

  abstract = {Natural sciences generate an increasing amount of data in a wide range of formats developed by different research groups and commercial companies. At the same time there is a growing desire to share data along with publications in order to enable reproducible research. Open formats have publicly available specifications which facilitate data sharing and reproducible research. Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) is a popular open format widely used in neuroscience, often as a foundation for other, more specialized formats. However, drawbacks related to HDF5's complex specification have initiated a discussion for an improved replacement. We propose a novel alternative, the Experimental Directory Structure (Exdir), an open standard for data storage in experimental pipelines which amends drawbacks associated with HDF5 while retaining its advantages. HDF5 stores data and metadata in a hierarchy within a complex binary file which, among other things, is not human-readable, not optimal for version control systems, and lacks support for storing raw data. Exdir, one the other hand, uses file system directories to represent the hierarchy, with metadata stored in human-readable YAML files, datasets stored in binary NumPy files, and raw data stored directly in subdirectories. Furthermore, storing data in multiple files makes it easier to track for version control systems. Exdir is not a file format in itself, but a standard for organizing files in a directory structure. Exdir uses the same abstractions as HDF5 and is compatible with the HDF5 Abstract Data Model. Several research groups are already using data stored in a directory hierarchy as an alternative to HDF5, but no common standard exists in the field. This complicates and limits the opportunity for data sharing and development of common tools for reading, writing, and analyzing data. Exdir facilitates improved data storage, data sharing, reproducible research, and novel insight from interdisciplinary collaboration. With the publication of Exdir, we invite the scientific community to join the development to create an open standard that will serve as many needs as possible and that will serve as a foundation for open access to and exchange of data.},

  abstract = {Video streaming today accounts for up to 55$\backslash$\% of mobile traffic. In this paper, we explore streaming videos encoded using Scalable Video Coding scheme (SVC) over highly variable bandwidth conditions such as cellular networks. SVC's unique encoding scheme allows the quality of a video chunk to change incrementally, making it more flexible and adaptive to challenging network conditions compared to other encoding schemes. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the quality decisions of video chunks constrained by the available bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines as an optimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel QoE metric that models a combination of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip duration of the video, maximizing the playback quality of every chunk, and minimizing the number of quality switches. Second, we develop Layered Bin Packing (LBP) Adaptation Algorithm, a novel algorithm that solves the proposed optimization problem. Moreover, we show that LBP achieves the optimal solution of the proposed optimization problem with linear complexity in the number of video chunks. Third, we propose an online algorithm (online LBP) where several challenges are addressed including handling bandwidth prediction errors, and short prediction duration. Extensive simulations with real bandwidth traces of public datasets reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its significant performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art SVC streaming algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also implemented on a TCP/IP emulation test bed with real LTE bandwidth traces, and the emulation confirms the simulation results and validates that the algorithm can be implemented and deployed on today's mobile devices.},

  abstract = {We present a method for estimating the complexity of an image based on Bennett's concept of logical depth. Bennett identified logical depth as the appropriate measure of organized complexity, and hence as being better suited to the evaluation of the complexity of objects in the physical world. Its use results in a different, and in some sense a finer characterization than is obtained through the application of the concept of Kolmogorov complexity alone. We use this measure to classify images by their information content. The method provides a means for classifying and evaluating the complexity of objects by way of their visual representations. To the authors' knowledge, the method and application inspired by the concept of logical depth presented herein are being proposed and implemented for the first time. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Entropy measures that assess signals' complexity have drawn increasing attention recently in biomedical field, as they have shown the ability of capturing unique features that are intrinsic and physiologically meaningful. In this study, we applied entropy analysis to electroencephalogram (EEG) data to examine its performance in epilepsy detection based on short-term EEG, aiming at establishing a short-term analysis protocol with optimal seizure detection performance. Two classification problems were considered, i.e., 1) classifying interictal and ictal EEGs (epileptic group) from normal EEGs; and 2) classifying ictal from interictal EEGs. For each problem, we explored two protocols to analyze the entropy of EEG: i) using a single analytical window with different window lengths, and ii) using an average of multiple windows for each window length. Two entropy methods-fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) and distribution entropy (DistEn)-were used that have valid outputs for any given data lengths. We performed feature selection and trained classifiers based on a cross-validation process. The results show that performance of FuzzyEn and DistEn may complement each other and the best performance can be achieved by combining: 1) FuzzyEn of one 5-s window and the averaged DistEn of five 1-s windows for classifying normal from epileptic group (accuracy: 0.93, sensitivity: 0.91, specificity: 0.96); and 2) the averaged FuzzyEn of five 1-s windows and DistEn of one 5-s window for classifying ictal from interictal EEGs (accuracy: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 0.90). Further studies are warranted to examine whether this proposed short-term analysis procedure can help track the epileptic activities in real time and provide prompt feedback for clinical practices.},

The MPF is devised to avoid the degeneration problem, which is inevitable in the particle filter (PF), without prohibitive computational cost. In addition, it is applicable to cases in which a nonlinear relationship exists between a state and observed data where the application of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is not effectual. In the MPF, the filtering procedure is performed based on sampling of a forecast ensemble as in the PF. However, unlike the PF, each member of a filtered ensemble is generated by merging multiple samples from the forecast ensemble such that the mean and covariance of the filtered distribution are approximately preserved. This merging of multiple samples allows the degeneration problem to be avoided. In the present study, the newly proposed MPF technique is introduced, and its performance is demonstrated experimentally.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in computational modeling of biological systems is the determination of the model parameters. Typically, only a fraction of the parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are experimentally measured, while the rest are often fitted. The fitting process is usually based on experimental time course measurements of observables, which are used to assign parameter values that minimize some measure of the error between these measurements and the corresponding model prediction. The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very noisy and taken at a limited number of time points. In this work we present a new approach to the problem of parameter selection of biological models. We show how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of the model parameters. The proposed method follows. First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that is particularly well suited to biological applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori identifiability test to check the reliability of the estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem to refine the first guess in case it should not be accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed to be statistically consistent with the measurements. Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used to discriminate among alternate models of the same biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by applying our methods to two examples, namely a model of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of a synthetic gene regulation system. The methods presented are quite general and may be applied to a wide class of biological systems where noisy measurements are used for parameter estimation or model selection.},

  abstract = {Construction of quantitative models is a primary goal of quantitative biology, which aims to understand cellular and organismal phenomena in a quantitative manner. In this article, we introduce optimization procedures to search for parameters in a quantitative model that can reproduce experimental data. The aim of optimization is to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) in a prediction or to maximize likelihood. A (local) maximum of likelihood or (local) minimum of the SSE can efficiently be identified using gradient approaches. Addition of a stochastic process enables us to identify the global maximum/minimum without becoming trapped in local maxima/minima. Sampling approaches take advantage of increasing computational power to test numerous sets of parameters in order to determine the optimum set. By combining Bayesian inference with gradient or sampling approaches, we can estimate both the optimum parameters and the form of the likelihood function related to the parameters. Finally, we introduce four examples of research that utilize parameter optimization to obtain biological insights from quantified data: transcriptional regulation, bacterial chemotaxis, morphogenesis, and cell cycle regulation. With practical knowledge of parameter optimization, cell and developmental biologists can develop realistic models that reproduce their observations and thus, obtain mechanistic insights into phenomena of interest.},

  doi = {10.3389/fphys.2017.00720},
  abstract = {Distribution entropy (DistEn) is a recently developed measure of complexity that is used to analyse heart rate variability (HRV) data. Its calculation requires two input parameters-the embedding dimension m, and the number of bins M which replaces the tolerance parameter r that is used by the existing approximation entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) measures. The performance of DistEn can also be affected by the data length N. In our previous studies, we have analyzed stability and performance of DistEn with respect to one parameter (m or M) or combination of two parameters (N and M). However, impact of varying all the three input parameters on DistEn is not yet studied. Since DistEn is predominantly aimed at analysing short length heart rate variability (HRV) signal, it is important to comprehensively study the stability, consistency and performance of the measure using multiple case studies. In this study, we examined the impact of changing input parameters on DistEn for synthetic and physiological signals. We also compared the variations of DistEn and performance in distinguishing physiological (Elderly from Young) and pathological (Healthy from Arrhythmia) conditions with ApEn and SampEn. The results showed that DistEn values are minimally affected by the variations of input parameters compared to ApEn and SampEn. DistEn also showed the most consistent and the best performance in differentiating physiological and pathological conditions with various of input parameters among reported complexity measures. In conclusion, DistEn is found to be the best measure for analysing short length HRV time series.},

  abstract = {Rough set approach is one of effective feature selection methods that can preserve the meaning of the features. So far, many feature selection (also called feature reduction) methods based on Rough set have been proposed. Of which, methods based on discernibility matrix are of considerable benefits for their conciseness and effectiveness, but have much higher space complexity. In order to reduce the storage space of the existing feature selection methods based on discernibility matrix, a novel condensing tree (C-Tree) structure was introduced, which is an extended order-tree, every nonempty element of a discernibility matrix is stored in one path in the C-Tree by given order of features and lots of nonempty elements share one path or sub-path, so the C-Tree has much lower space complexity as compared to discernibility matrix. However, the size of a C-Tree greatly depends on the order of features in most cases, hence how to set the proper order of features is of importance. To generate a higher compressed C-Tree, in this paper, after introducing an efficient trick for efficiently measuring the relative importance of every feature, we present a new feature ordering strategy according to the descending order of their importance. Further, based on the new feature ordering strategy, corresponding two heuristic algorithms for feature selection are introduced. Algorithms of this paper are experimented using six standard datasets and five synthetic datasets for testing both time and space complexities. Experimental results show that the newly improved feature selection algorithm can further efficiently reduce cost of storage in most cases.},

  abstract = {Fusing the outputs of an ensemble of diverse predictive models usually boosts overall prediction accuracy. Such fusion is guided by each model's local performance, i.e., each model's prediction accuracy in the neighborhood of the probe point. Therefore, for each probe we instantiate a customized fusion mechanism. The fusion mechanism is a meta-model, i.e., a model that operates one level above the object-level models whose predictions we want to fuse. Like these models, such a meta-model is defined by structural and parametric information. In this paper, we focus on the definition of the parametric information for a given structure. For each probe point, we either retrieve or compute the parameters to instantiate the associated meta-model. The retrieval approach is based on a CART-derived segmentation of the probe's state space, which contains the meta-model parameters. The computation approach is based on a run-time evaluation of each model's local performance in the neighborhood of the probe. We explore various structures for the meta-model, and for each structure we compare the pre-compiled (retrieval) or run-time (computation) approaches. We demonstrate this fusion methodology in the context of multiple neural network models. However, our methodology is broadly applicable to other predictive modeling approaches. This fusion method is illustrated in the development of highly accurate models for emissions, efficiency, and load prediction in a complex power plant. The locally weighted fusion method boosts the predictive performance by 30\textendash{}50\% over the baseline single model approach for the various prediction targets. Relative to this approach, typical fusion strategies that use averaging or globally weighting schemes only produce a 2\textendash{}6\% performance boost over the same baseline.},

Sigmoid function is a smoothed and continuous version of Heaviside function. To overcome the problems SampEn encountered, a modified SampEn (mSampEn) based on nonlinear Sigmoid function was proposed. The performance of mSampEn was tested on the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform random numbers, the MIX stochastic model, the Rossler map, and the Hennon map. The results showed that mSampEn was superior to SampEn in several aspects, including giving entropy definition in case of small parameters, better relative consistency, robust to noise, and more independence on record length when characterizing time series generated from either deterministic or stochastic system with different regularities.},

Since vectors' similarity is defined on the basis of the hard and sensitive boundary of Heaviside function in ApEn and SampEn, the two families of statistics show high sensitivity to the parameter selection and may be invalid in case of small parameter. Importing the concept of fuzzy sets, we developed a new measure FuzzyEn, where vectors' similarity is defined by fuzzy similarity degree based on fuzzy membership functions and vectors' shapes. The soft and continuous boundaries of fuzzy functions ensure the continuity as well as the validity of FuzzyEn at small parameters. The more details obtained by fuzzy functions also make FuzzyEn a more accurate entropy definition than ApEn and SampEn. In addition, similarity definition based on vectors' shapes, together with the exclusion of self-matches, earns FuzzyEn stronger relative consistency and less dependence on data length. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that FuzzyEn provides an improved evaluation of signal complexity and can be more conveniently and powerfully applied to short time series contaminated by noise.},

The average autocorrelation of multiple realizations of fGn converges to the theoretically expected autocorrelation. Two methods, commonly used to generate fractal time series, an approximate spectral synthesis (SSM) method and the successive random addition (SRA) method, do not give the correct correlation structures and should be abandoned. Time series from fGp were used to test how well several versions of rescaled range analysis (R/S) and dispersional analysis (Disp) estimate the Hurst coefficient (0 $<$ H $<$ 1.0). Disp is unbiased for H $<$ 0.9 and series length N $\geqslant$ 1024, but underestimates H when H $>$ 0.9 R/S-detrended overestimates H for time series with H $<$ 0.7 and underestimates H for H $>$ 0.7. Estimates of H(\^H) from all versions of Disp usually have lower bias and variance than those from R/S.

  abstract = {Lorenz (1963) has investigated a system of three first-order differential equations, whose solutions tend toward a ``strange attractor''. We show that the same properties can be observed in a simple mapping of the plane defined by:xi+1=y i +1-ax i 2 ,yi+1=bx i . Numerical experiments are carried out fora=1.4,b=0.3. Depending on the initial point (x0,y0), the sequence of points obtained by iteration of the mapping either diverges to infinity or tends to a strange attractor, which appears to be the product of a one-dimensional manifold by a Cantor set.},

Mapping this coupling between activity pattern and gene induction would allow inference of~a neuron's activity-pattern history from its gene~expression and improve our understanding of activity-pattern-dependent synaptic plasticity. In genome-scale experiments comparing brief and sustained activity patterns, we reveal that activity-duration history can be inferred from gene expression profiles. Brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the activity-regulated gene program that corresponds to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. Induction of these first-wave genes is mechanistically distinct from that of the later waves because it requires MAPK/ERK signaling but does not require de novo translation. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the~multi-wave temporal structure of gene induction~also enable different gene sets to be induced by different activity durations.},

For mammals, the neocortex plays a particularly profound role in generating sensory perception, controlling voluntary movement, higher cognitive functions and planning goal-directed behaviours. Since these remarkable functions of the neocortex cannot be explored in simple model preparations or in anesthetised animals, the neural basis of behaviour must be explored in awake behaving subjects. Because neocortical function is highly distributed across many rapidly interacting regions, it is essential to measure spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical activity in real-time. Extensive work in anesthetised mammals has shown that in vivo Voltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging (VSDI) reveals the neocortical population membrane potential dynamics at millisecond temporal resolution and subcolumnar spatial resolution. Here, we describe recent advances indicating that VSDI is also already well-developed for exploring cortical function in behaving monkeys and mice.

In the rodent, VSDI is applicable to freely moving and awake head-restrained mice. Interactions between different cortical areas and different cortical columns can therefore now be dynamically mapped through VSDI and related to the corresponding behaviour.

  shorttitle = {{{NoRMCorre}}},
  abstract = {Background
Motion correction is a challenging pre-processing problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium imaging data sequences. The motion artifacts in two-photon microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain medium.
New method
We introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) based on template matching. NoRMCorre operates by splitting the field of view (FOV) into overlapping spatial patches along all directions. The patches are registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation against a regularly updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid artifacts in a piecewise-rigid manner.
Existing methods
Existing approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational performance or are targeted to non-rigid artifacts arising just from the finite speed of raster scanning, and thus cannot correct for non-rigid motion observable in datasets from a large FOV.
Results
NoRMCorre can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration of streaming data. We evaluate its performance with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on simulated data and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available.
Conclusions
The proposed method and accompanying code can be useful for solving large scale image registration problems in calcium imaging, especially in the presence of non-rigid deformations.},

  abstract = {The application of 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) techniques to measure the dynamics of cellular calcium signals in populations of neurons is an extremely powerful technique for characterizing neural activity within the central nervous system. The use of TPLSM on awake and behaving subjects promises new insights into how neural circuit elements cooperatively interact to form sensory perceptions and generate behavior. A major challenge in imaging such preparations is unavoidable animal and tissue movement, which leads to shifts in the imaging location (jitter). The presence of image motion can lead to artifacts, especially since quantification of TPLSM images involves analysis of fluctuations in fluorescence intensities for each neuron, determined from small regions of interest (ROIs). Here, we validate a new motion correction approach to compensate for motion of TPLSM images in the superficial layers of auditory cortex of awake mice. We use a nominally uniform fluorescent signal as a secondary signal to complement the dynamic signals from genetically encoded calcium indicators. We tested motion correction for single plane time lapse imaging as well as multiplane (i.e., volume) time lapse imaging of cortical tissue. Our procedure of motion correction relies on locating the brightest neurons and tracking their positions over time using established techniques of particle finding and tracking. We show that our tracking based approach provides subpixel resolution without compromising speed. Unlike most established methods, our algorithm also captures deformations of the field of view and thus can compensate e.g., for rotations. Object tracking based motion correction thus offers an alternative approach for motion correction, one that is well suited for real time spike inference analysis and feedback control, and for correcting for tissue distortions.},

In such cases spectral imaging of the fluorescence data and subsequent linear unmixing allows the separation even of highly overlapping fluorophores into pure signals.

We then introduce the calcium imaging devices, including confocal and two-photon microscopy as well as miniaturized devices that are used in freely moving animals. We provide an overview of the classical chemical fluorescent calcium indicators and of the protein-based genetically encoded calcium indicators. Using application examples, we introduce new developments in the field, such as calcium imaging in awake, behaving animals and the use of calcium imaging for mapping single spine sensory inputs in cortical neurons in~vivo. We conclude by providing an outlook on the prospects of calcium imaging for the analysis of neuronal signaling and plasticity in various animal models.},

  abstract = {Two-photon imaging of bulk-loaded calcium dyes can record action potentials (APs) simultaneously from dozens of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. Extending this technique to awake animals, however, has remained technically challenging due to artifacts caused by brain motion. Since in two-photon excitation microscopes image pixels are captured sequentially by scanning a focused pulsed laser across small areas of interest within the brain, fast displacements of the imaged area can distort the image nonuniformly. If left uncorrected, brain motion in awake animals will cause artifactual fluorescence changes, masking the small functional fluorescence increases associated with AP discharge. We therefore present a procedure for detection and correction of both fast and slow displacements in two-photon imaging of awake animals. Our algorithm, based on the Lucas\textendash{}Kanade framework, operates directly on the motion-distorted imaging data, requiring neither external signals such as heartbeat nor a distortion-free template image. Motion correction accuracy was tested in silico over a wide range of simplified and realistic displacement trajectories and for multiple levels of fluorescence noise. Accuracy was confirmed in vivo by comparing solutions obtained from red and green fluorophores imaged simultaneously. Finally, the accuracy of AP detection from motion-displaced bulk-loaded calcium imaging is evaluated with and without motion correction, and we conclude that accurate motion correction as achieved by this procedure is both necessary and sufficient for single AP detection in awake animals.},

  abstract = {Augmenting evidence suggests that such is the functional dependence of neural stem cells (NSCs) on the vasculature that they normally reside in ``perivascular niches''. Two examples are the ``neurovascular '' and the ``oligovascular '' niches of the adult brain, specialized microenvironments where NSCs or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells survive and remain mitotically active in close proximity to blood vessels. In addition, the often observed co-ordination of angiogenesis and neurogenesis led to these processes being described as ``coupled''. Here, we adopt an evo-devo approach to argue that some stages in the life of a NSC, such as specification and commitment, are independent of the vasculature, while stages such as proliferation and migration are largely dependent on blood vessels. We also explore available evidence on the possible involvement of the vasculature in other phenomena such as the diversification of NSCs during evolution and we provide original data on the senescence of NSCs in the subependymal zone stem cell niche. Finally, we will comment on the other side of the story; on how much is the vasculature dependent on NSCs and their progeny.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0179419},
  abstract = {Local Ca2+ Releases (LCRs) are crucial events involved in cardiac pacemaker cell function. However, specific algorithms for automatic LCR detection and analysis have not been developed in live, spontaneously beating pacemaker cells. In the present study we measured LCRs using a high-speed 2D-camera in spontaneously contracting sinoatrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the LCRs spatially in two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline of the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine transform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not contract. Action potential-induced Ca2+ transients and LCRs were thereafter isolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The LCR birth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame) sensitivity algorithm applied to each pixel (cell location). An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently quickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died when its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising whole cell Ca2+ transient. Ultimately, our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as period, signal mass, duration, and propagation path area. As the LCRs propagate within live cells, the algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the importance of locally propagating Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a powerful ensemble Ca2+ signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion artifacts and detect 2D local spatiotemporal events from recording noise and global signals. While the algorithms were developed to detect LCRs in sinoatrial nodal cells, they have the potential to be used in other applications in biophysics and cell physiology, for example, to detect Ca2+ wavelets (abortive waves), sparks and embers in muscle cells and Ca2+ puffs and syntillas in neurons.},

Out of focus fluorescence from surrounding neuropil and other cells can strongly contaminate the signal assigned to a given ROI. In this study, we introduce the FISSA toolbox (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) for neuropil decontamination. Given pre-defined ROIs, the FISSA toolbox automatically extracts the surrounding local neuropil and performs blind-source separation with non-negative matrix factorization. Using both simulated and in vivo data, we show that this toolbox performs similarly or better than existing published methods. FISSA requires only little RAM, and allows for fast processing of large datasets even on a standard laptop. The FISSA toolbox is available in Python, with an option for MATLAB format outputs, and can easily be integrated into existing workflows.

Here, we report a protocol for two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the auditory cortex of head-fixed behaving mice. By using a custom-made head fixation apparatus and a head-rotated fixation procedure, we achieved two-photon imaging and in combination with targeted cell-attached recordings of auditory cortical neurons in behaving mice. Using synthetic Ca2+ indicators, we recorded the Ca2+ transients at multiple scales, including neuronal populations, single neurons, dendrites and single spines, in auditory cortex during behavior. Furthermore, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs), we monitored the neuronal dynamics over days throughout the process of associative learning. Therefore, we achieved two-photon functional imaging at multiple scales in auditory cortex of behaving mice, which extends the tool box for investigating the neural basis of audition-related behaviors.},

  abstract = {Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBT) neural circuits are critical modulators of cognitive and motor function. When compromised, these circuits contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, motor deficits correlate with the emergence of exaggerated beta frequency (15\textendash{}30 Hz) oscillations throughout the CBT network. However, little is known about how specific cell types within individual CBT brain regions support the generation, propagation, and interaction of oscillatory dynamics throughout the CBT circuit or how specific oscillatory dynamics are related to motor function. Here, we investigated the role of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SChIs) in generating beta and gamma oscillations in cortical-striatal circuits and in influencing movement behavior. We found that selective stimulation of SChIs via optogenetics in normal mice robustly and reversibly amplified beta and gamma oscillations that are supported by distinct mechanisms within striatal-cortical circuits. Whereas beta oscillations are supported robustly in the striatum and all layers of primary motor cortex (M1) through a muscarinic-receptor mediated mechanism, gamma oscillations are largely restricted to the striatum and the deeper layers of M1. Finally, SChI activation led to parkinsonian-like motor deficits in otherwise normal mice. These results highlight the important role of striatal cholinergic interneurons in supporting oscillations in the CBT network that are closely related to movement and parkinsonian motor symptoms.},

  abstract = {We present two techniques to improve landmark localization in images from partially annotated datasets. Our primary goal is to leverage the common situation where precise landmark locations are only provided for a small data subset, but where class labels for classification or regression tasks related to the landmarks are more abundantly available. First, we propose the framework of sequential multitasking and explore it here through an architecture for landmark localization where training with class labels acts as an auxiliary signal to guide the landmark localization on unlabeled data. A key aspect of our approach is that errors can be backpropagated through a complete landmark localization model. Second, we propose and explore an unsupervised learning technique for landmark localization based on having a model predict equivariant landmarks with respect to transformations applied to the image. We show that these techniques, improve landmark prediction considerably and can learn effective detectors even when only a small fraction of the dataset has landmark labels. We present results on two toy datasets and four real datasets, with hands and faces, and report new state-of-the-art on two datasets in the wild, e.g. with only 5$\backslash$\% of labeled images we outperform previous state-of-the-art trained on the AFLW dataset.},

  abstract = {This work presents a theory and methodology for simultaneous detection of local spatial and temporal scales in video data. The underlying idea is that if we process video data by spatio-temporal receptive fields at multiple spatial and temporal scales, we would like to generate hypotheses about the spatial extent and the temporal duration of the underlying spatio-temporal image structures that gave rise to the feature responses. For two types of spatio-temporal scale-space representations, (i) a non-causal Gaussian spatio-temporal scale space for offline analysis of pre-recorded video sequences and (ii) a time-causal and time-recursive spatio-temporal scale space for online analysis of real-time video streams, we express sufficient conditions for spatio-temporal feature detectors in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields to deliver scale-covariant and scale-invariant feature responses. We present an in-depth theoretical analysis of the scale selection properties of eight types of spatio-temporal interest point detectors in terms of either: (i)\textendash{}(ii) the spatial Laplacian applied to the first- and second-order temporal derivatives, (iii)\textendash{}(iv) the determinant of the spatial Hessian applied to the first- and second-order temporal derivatives, (v) the determinant of the spatio-temporal Hessian matrix, (vi) the spatio-temporal Laplacian and (vii)\textendash{}(viii) the first- and second-order temporal derivatives of the determinant of the spatial Hessian matrix. It is shown that seven of these spatio-temporal feature detectors allow for provable scale covariance and scale invariance. Then, we describe a time-causal and time-recursive algorithm for detecting sparse spatio-temporal interest points from video streams and show that it leads to intuitively reasonable results. An experimental quantification of the accuracy of the spatio-temporal scale estimates and the amount of temporal delay obtained from these spatio-temporal interest point detectors is given, showing that: (i) the spatial and temporal scale selection properties predicted by the continuous theory are well preserved in the discrete implementation and (ii) the spatial Laplacian or the determinant of the spatial Hessian applied to the first- and second-order temporal derivatives leads to much shorter temporal delays in a time-causal implementation compared to the determinant of the spatio-temporal Hessian or the first- and second-order temporal derivatives of the determinant of the spatial Hessian matrix.},

We present two original methods that use the outputs of cascaded digital filters in deriving KMs. The first approach uses the digital filter outputs to form geometric moments (GMs) and the KMs are obtained via GMs. The second method uses a direct relationship to obtain KMs from the digital filter outputs. This is possible thanks to the formulation of Krawtchouk polynomials in terms of binomial functions, which are equivalent to the digital filter outputs. In this study, the performance of the proposed techniques is compared with other existing methods of KMs calculation. The experimental study shows that the first and the second proposed techniques perform 57\% and 87\% faster than the recurrence method for a real image of a size 128\texttimes{}128 pixels, which performs a significant improvement.},

  abstract = {Current Light Field (LF) cameras offer fixed resolution in space, time and angle which is decided a-priori and is independent of the scene. These cameras either trade-off spatial resolution to capture single-shot LF or tradeoff temporal resolution by assuming a static scene to capture high spatial resolution LF. Thus, capturing high spatial resolution LF video for dynamic scenes remains an open and challenging problem. We present the concept, design and implementation of a LF video camera that allows capturing high resolution LF video. The spatial, angular and temporal resolution are not fixed a-priori and we exploit the scene-specific redundancy in space, time and angle. Our reconstruction is motion-aware and offers a continuum of resolution tradeoff with increasing motion in the scene. The key idea is (a) to design efficient multiplexing matrices that allow resolution tradeoffs, (b) use dictionary learning and sparse representations for robust reconstruction, and (c) perform local motion-aware adaptive reconstruction. We perform extensive analysis and characterize the performance of our motion-aware reconstruction algorithm. We show realistic simulations using a graphics simulator as well as real results using a LCoS based programmable camera. We demonstrate novel results such as high resolution digital refocusing for dynamic moving objects.},

The observed intensity at a pixel is an integration of the incoming light modulated by its specific shutter. We propose a reconstruction algorithm that uses the data from P2C2 along with additional priors about videos to perform temporal super-resolution. We model the spatial redundancy of videos using sparse representations and the temporal redundancy using brightness constancy constraints inferred via optical flow. We show that by modeling such spatio-temporal redundancies in a video volume, one can faithfully recover the underlying high-speed video frames from the observed low speed coded video. The imaging architecture and the reconstruction algorithm allows us to achieve temporal super-resolution without loss in spatial resolution.

  abstract = {Spatial multiplexing cameras (SMCs) acquire a (typically static) scene through a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator (e.g., a digital micro-mirror device) and a few optical sensors. This approach finds use in imaging applications where full-frame sensors are either too expensive (e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or unavailable. Existing SMC systems reconstruct static scenes using techniques from compressive sensing (CS). For videos, however, existing acquisition and recovery methods deliver poor quality. In this paper, we propose the CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework for high-quality video acquisition and recovery using SMCs. Our framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the efficient computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling high-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow estimates from the low-resolution previews and impose them as constraints in the recovery procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CS-MUVI framework for a host of synthetic and real measured SMC video data, and we show that high-quality videos can be recovered at roughly 60\texttimes{} compression.},

We propose different components of video camera design: a sampling scheme, processing of captured data and hardware that offer post-capture variable spatial and temporal resolution trade-offs. Our sampling scheme samples multiple spatio-temporal resolutions, without increasing the total number of measurements. Our post-processing allows for a continuum of different spatio-temporal resolutions, while minimizing the reconstruction artifacts due to aliasing. Using the motion information in the captured data, we decide the correct resolution for each location automatically. Our techniques make it possible to capture fast moving objects without motion blur, while simultaneously preserving high-spatial resolution for static scene parts within the same video sequence.

  abstract = {Cameras face a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. Digital still cameras can capture images with high spatial resolution, but most high-speed video cameras have relatively low spatial resolution. It is hard to overcome this trade-off without incurring a significant increase in hardware costs. In this paper, we propose techniques for sampling, representing, and reconstructing the space-time volume to overcome this trade-off. Our approach has two important distinctions compared to previous works: 1) We achieve sparse representation of videos by learning an overcomplete dictionary on video patches, and 2) we adhere to practical hardware constraints on sampling schemes imposed by architectures of current image sensors, which means that our sampling function can be implemented on CMOS image sensors with modified control units in the future. We evaluate components of our approach, sampling function and sparse representation, by comparing them to several existing approaches. We also implement a prototype imaging system with pixel-wise coded exposure control using a liquid crystal on silicon device. System characteristics such as field of view and modulation transfer function are evaluated for our imaging system. Both simulations and experiments on a wide range of scenes show that our method can effectively reconstruct a video from a single coded image while maintaining high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Video cameras are invariably bandwidth limited and this results in a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. Advances in sensor manufacturing technology have tremendously increased the available spatial resolution of modern cameras while simultaneously lowering the costs of these sensors. In stark contrast, hardware improvements in temporal resolution have been modest. One solution to enhance temporal resolution is to use high bandwidth imaging devices such as high speed sensors and camera arrays. Unfortunately, these solutions are expensive. An alternate solution is motivated by recent advances in computational imaging and compressive sensing. Camera designs based on these principles, typically, modulate the incoming video using spatio-temporal light modulators and capture the modulated video at a lower bandwidth. Reconstruction algorithms, motivated by compressive sensing, are subsequently used to recover the high bandwidth video at high fidelity. Though promising, these methods have been limited since they require complex and expensive light modulators that make the techniques difficult to realize in practice. In this paper, we show that a simple coded exposure modulation is sufficient to reconstruct high speed videos. We propose the Flutter Shutter Video Camera (FSVC) in which each exposure of the sensor is temporally coded using an independent pseudo-random sequence. Such exposure coding is easily achieved in modern sensors and is already a feature of several machine vision cameras. We also develop two algorithms for reconstructing the high speed video; the first based on minimizing the total variation of the spatio-temporal slices of the video and the second based on a data driven dictionary based approximation. We perform evaluation on simulated videos and real data to illustrate the robustness of our system.},

By placing a randomly coded mask at the aperture of a camera, incoherent measurements of the light passing through different parts of the lens are encoded in the captured images. Each captured image is a random linear combination of different angular views of a scene. The encoded images are then used to recover the original light field image via a novel Bayesian reconstruction algorithm. Using the principles of compressive sensing, we show that light field images with a large number of angular views can be recovered from only a few acquisitions. Moreover, the proposed acquisition and recovery method provides light field images with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio, and therefore is not affected by limitations common to existing light field camera designs. We present a prototype camera design based on the proposed framework by modifying a regular digital camera.

  abstract = {FlatCam is a thin form-factor lensless camera that consists of a coded mask placed on top of a bare, conventional sensor array. Unlike a traditional, lens-based camera where an image of the scene is directly recorded on the sensor pixels, each pixel in FlatCam records a linear combination of light from multiple scene elements. A computational algorithm is then used to demultiplex the recorded measurements and reconstruct an image of the scene. FlatCam is an instance of a coded aperture imaging system; however, unlike the vast majority of related work, we place the coded mask extremely close to the image sensor that can enable a thin system. We employ a separable mask to ensure that both calibration and image reconstruction are scalable in terms of memory requirements and computational complexity. We demonstrate the potential of the FlatCam design using two prototypes: one at visible wavelengths and one at infrared wavelengths.},

  abstract = {The nervous system of the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris exhibits remarkable regenerative abilities. When cut in two, the bisected tissue reorganizes into fully behaving animals in approximately 48 hours. Furthermore, new animals can reform from aggregates of dissociated cells. Understanding how behaviors are coordinated by this highly plastic nervous system could reveal basic principles of neural circuit dynamics underlying behaviors. However, Hydra's deformable and contractile body makes it difficult to manipulate the local environment while recording neural activity. Here, we present the first microfluidic technologies capable of simultaneous electrical, chemical, and optical interrogation of these soft, deformable organisms. Specifically, we demonstrate devices that can immobilize Hydra for hours-long simultaneous electrical and optical recording, and chemical stimulation of behaviors revealing neural activity during muscle contraction. We further demonstrate quantitative locomotive and behavioral tracking made possible by confining the animal to quasi-two-dimensional micro-arenas. Together, these proof-of-concept devices show that microfluidics provide a platform for scalable, quantitative cnidarian neurobiology. The experiments enabled by this technology may help reveal how highly plastic networks of neurons provide robust control of animal behavior.},

First, we build a dual-camera system that simultaneously captures a panchromatic video at a high frame rate and a hyperspectral video at a low frame rate, which jointly provide reliable projections for the underlying HSHS video. Second, we exploit the panchromatic video to learn an over-complete 3D dictionary to represent each band-wise video sparsely, and a robust computational reconstruction is then employed to recover the HSHS video based on the joint videos and the self-learned dictionary. Experimental results demonstrate that, for the first time to our knowledge, the hyperspectral video frame rate reaches up to 100fps with decent quality, even when the incident light is not strong.},

After registration of the two video streams, our system propagates the multispectral information into the RGB video to produce a video with both high spectral and spatial resolution. This propagation between videos is guided by color similarity of pixels in the spectral domain, proximity in the spatial domain, and the consistent color of each scene point in the temporal domain. The propagation algorithm is designed for rapid computation to allow real-time video generation at the original frame rate, and can thus facilitate real-time video analysis tasks such as tracking and surveillance. Hardware implementation details and design tradeoffs are discussed. We evaluate the proposed system using both simulations with ground truth data and on real-world scenes. The utility of this high resolution multispectral video data is demonstrated in dynamic white balance adjustment and tracking.},

  abstract = {Conventional scanning and multiplexing techniques for hyperspectral imaging suffer from limited temporal and/or spatial resolution. To resolve this issue, coding techniques are becoming increasingly popular in developing snapshot systems for high-resolution hyperspectral imaging. For such systems, it is a critical task to accurately restore the 3D hyperspectral image from its corresponding coded 2D image. In this paper, we propose an effective method for coded hyperspectral image restoration, which exploits extensive structure sparsity in the hyperspectral image. Specifically, we simultaneously explore spectral and spatial correlation via low-rank regularizations, and formulate the restoration problem into a variational optimization model, which can be solved via an iterative numerical algorithm. Experimental results using both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on several popular coding-based hyperspectral imaging systems.},

The wavelength-dependent data are coded and then superposed, mapping the three-dimensional hyperspectral datacube to a two-dimensional image. The inversion algorithm learns a dictionary in situ from the measurements via global-local shrinkage priors. By using RGB images as side information of the compressive sensing system, the proposed approach is extended to learn a coupled dictionary from the joint dataset of the compressed measurements and the corresponding RGB images, to improve reconstruction quality. A prototype camera is built using a liquid-crystal-on-silicon modulator. Experimental reconstructions of hyperspectral datacubes from both simulated and real compressed measurements demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed inversion algorithm, the feasibility of the camera and the benefit of side information.},

The proposed architecture comprises three key components: spatial-spectral encoded optical camera design, over-complete HS dictionary learning and sparse-constraint computational reconstruction. Our spatial-spectral encoded sampling scheme provides a higher degree of randomness in the measured projections than previous compressive HS imaging approaches; and a robust nonlinear sparse reconstruction method is employed to recover the HS images from the coded projection with higher performance. To exploit the sparsity constraint on the nature HS images for computational reconstruction, an over-complete HS dictionary is learned to represent the HS images in a sparser way than previous representations. We validate the proposed approach on both synthetic and real captured data, and show successful recovery of HS images for both indoor and outdoor scenes. In addition, we demonstrate other applications for the over-complete HS dictionary and sparse coding techniques, including 3D HS images compression and denoising.},

While existing recovery algorithms for SMCs perform well for static images, they typically fail for time-varying scenes (videos).

Our framework features a co-designed video CS sensing matrix and recovery algorithm that provide an efficiently computable low-resolution video preview. We estimate the scene\&\#39;s optical flow from the video preview and feed it into a convex-optimization algorithm to recover the high-resolution video.

This new method considers, in an exact way, the effects of high order spike train statistics, with no approximation involved, and it generalizes our previous work that was valid for short time windows and small populations. The new technique permits one to quantify the information transmitted if each cell were to convey fully independent information separately from the information available in the presence of synergy-redundancy effects. Synergy-redundancy effects are shown to arise from three possible contributions: a redundant contribution due to similarities in the mean response profiles of different cells; a synergistic stimulus-dependent correlational contribution quantifying the information content of changes of correlations with stimulus, and a stimulus-independent correlational contribution term that reflects interactions between the distribution of rates of individual cells and the average level of cross-correlation. We apply the new method to simultaneously recorded data from somatosensory and visual cortices. We demonstrate that it constitutes a reliable tool to determine the role of cross-correlated activity in stimulus coding even when high firing rate data (such as multi-unit recordings) are considered.},

  abstract = {Background
Information theory is an increasingly popular framework for studying how the brain encodes sensory information. Despite its widespread use for the analysis of spike trains of single neurons and of small neural populations, its application to the analysis of other types of neurophysiological signals (EEGs, LFPs, BOLD) has remained relatively limited so far. This is due to the limited-sampling bias which affects calculation of information, to the complexity of the techniques to eliminate the bias, and to the lack of publicly available fast routines for the information analysis of multi-dimensional responses.

Results
Here we introduce a new C- and Matlab-based information theoretic toolbox, specifically developed for neuroscience data. This toolbox implements a novel computationally-optimized algorithm for estimating many of the main information theoretic quantities and bias correction techniques used in neuroscience applications. We illustrate and test the toolbox in several ways. First, we verify that these algorithms provide accurate and unbiased estimates of the information carried by analog brain signals (i.e. LFPs, EEGs, or BOLD) even when using limited amounts of experimental data. This test is important since existing algorithms were so far tested primarily on spike trains. Second, we apply the toolbox to the analysis of EEGs recorded from a subject watching natural movies, and we characterize the electrodes locations, frequencies and signal features carrying the most visual information. Third, we explain how the toolbox can be used to break down the information carried by different features of the neural signal into distinct components reflecting different ways in which correlations between parts of the neural signal contribute to coding. We illustrate this breakdown by analyzing LFPs recorded from primary visual cortex during presentation of naturalistic movies.

Conclusion
The new toolbox presented here implements fast and data-robust computations of the most relevant quantities used in information theoretic analysis of neural data. The toolbox can be easily used within Matlab, the environment used by most neuroscience laboratories for the acquisition, preprocessing and plotting of neural data. It can therefore significantly enlarge the domain of application of information theory to neuroscience, and lead to new discoveries about the neural code.},

  abstract = {To improve the compression rates for lossless compression of medical images, an efficient algorithm, based on irregular segmentation and region-based prediction, is proposed in this paper. Considering that the first step of a region-based compression algorithm is segmentation, this paper proposes a hybrid method by combining geometry-adaptive partitioning and quadtree partitioning to achieve adaptive irregular segmentation for medical images. Then, least square (LS)-based predictors are adaptively designed for each region (regular subblock or irregular subregion). The proposed adaptive algorithm not only exploits spatial correlation between pixels but it utilizes local structure similarity, resulting in efficient compression performance. Experimental results show that the average compression performance of the proposed algorithm is 10.48, 4.86, 3.58, and 0.10\% better than that of JPEG 2000, CALIC, EDP, and JPEG-LS, respectively.

The proposed method employs adaptive block size-based spatial prediction to predict blocks directly in the spatial domain and Lossless Hadamard Transform before quantization to improve the quality of reconstructed images. The block-based prediction breaks the pixel neighborhood constraint and takes full advantage of the local spatial correlations found in medical images. The adaptive block size guarantees a more rational division of images and the improved use of the local structure. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently compress medical images and produces a better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) under the same pre-defined distortion than other near-lossless methods.},

However, existing data frame solutions are either not distributed (e.g., Pandas in Python) and therefore have limited scalability, or they are not tightly integrated with array computations (e.g., Spark SQL). This paper proposes a novel compiler-based approach where we integrate data frames into the High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT) to build HiFrames. It provides expressive and flexible data frame APIs which are tightly integrated with array operations. HiFrames then automatically parallelizes and compiles relational operations along with other array computations in end-to-end data analytics programs, and generates efficient MPI/C++ code. We demonstrate that HiFrames is significantly faster than alternatives such as Spark SQL on clusters, without forcing the programmer to switch to embedded SQL for part of the program. HiFrames is 3.6x to 70x faster than Spark SQL for basic relational operations, and can be up to 20,000x faster for advanced analytics operations, such as weighted moving averages (WMA), that the map-reduce paradigm cannot handle effectively. HiFrames is also 5x faster than Spark SQL for TPCx-BB Q26 on 64 nodes of Cori supercomputer.},

Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.},

These circuits can be engaged in visually driven navigation, a behavior at which mice are adept. However, the properties of global motion perception in mice are unclear. Therefore, we developed a touchscreen-based, two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task to explore global motion detection in mice using random dot kinematograms (RDK). Performance data was used to compute coherence thresholds for global motion perception. The touchscreen-based task allowed for parallel training and testing with multiple chambers and minimal experimenter intervention with mice performing hundreds of trials per session. Parameters of the random dot kinematograms, including dot size, lifetime, and speed, were tested. Mice learned to discriminate kinematograms whose median motion direction differed by 90 degrees in 7-24days after a 10-14day pre-training period. The average coherence threshold (measured at 70\% correct) in mice for this task was 22$\pm$5\%, with a dot diameter of 3.88mm and speed of 58.2mm/s. Our results confirm the ability of mice to perform global motion discriminations, and the touchscreen assay provides a flexible, automated, and relatively high throughput method with which to probe complex visual function in mice.},

  abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging can provide an optical readout of spiking activity with cellular resolution, revealing activity correlations and population dynamics within an individual cortical area. However, many conventional two-photon imaging systems maintain cellular resolution only over a field of view (FOV) \textasciitilde{}500 $\mu$m wide. This FOV precludes the simultaneous visualization of multiple cortical areas, which can be spread over a millimeter or more. Thus it has not typically been possible to use two-photon calcium imaging to measure neural activity dynamics and correlations between cortical areas. Here, we demonstrate a new two-photon imaging system that is designed to image neural activity in multiple cortical areas simultaneously. Low aberration scan optics support an expanded FOV with cellular resolution that is 1.4 to 1.8 mm wide using a commercially available objective, and 3.5 mm wide using a custom objective. Two independently positionable multiplexed excitation pathways simultaneously image any two regions within the expanded FOV. We use this new imaging system to measure activity correlations between two cortical visual areas in mice.},

Although there has been recent progress in extending the FOV in TPM, a principled design approach for developing large FOV TPM (LF-TPM) with off-the-shelf components has yet to be established. Therefore, we present a design strategy that depends on analyzing the optical invariant of commercially available objectives, relay lenses, mirror scanners, and emission collection systems in isolation. Components are then selected to maximize the space-bandwidth product of the integrated microscope. In comparison with other LF-TPM systems, our strategy simplifies the sequence of design decisions and is applicable to extending the FOV in any microscope with an optical relay.

  abstract = {In vivo wide-field imaging of neural activity with a high spatio-temporal resolution is a challenge in modern neuroscience. Although two-photon imaging is very powerful, high-speed imaging of the activity of individual synapses is mostly limited to a field of approximately 200\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m on a side. Wide-field one-photon epifluorescence imaging can reveal neuronal activity over a field of $\geq$1\,mm2 at a high speed, but is not able to resolve a single synapse. Here, to achieve a high spatio-temporal resolution, we combine an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera with spinning-disk one-photon confocal microscopy. This combination allowed us to image a 1 mm2 field with a pixel resolution of 0.21\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m at 60 fps. When we imaged motor cortical layer 1 in a behaving head-restrained mouse, calcium transients were detected in presynaptic boutons of thalamocortical axons sparsely labeled with GCaMP6s, although their density was lower than when two-photon imaging was used. The effects of out-of-focus fluorescence changes on calcium transients in individual boutons appeared minimal. Axonal boutons with highly correlated activity were detected over the 1\,mm2 field, and were probably distributed on multiple axonal arbors originating from the same thalamic neuron. This new microscopy with an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera should serve to clarify the activity and plasticity of widely distributed cortical synapses.},

  abstract = {Modern biology increasingly relies on fluorescence microscopy, which is driving demand for smaller, lighter, and cheaper microscopes. However, traditional microscope architectures suffer from a fundamental trade-off: As lenses become smaller, they must either collect less light or image a smaller field of view. To break this fundamental trade-off between device size and performance, we present a new concept for three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging that replaces lenses with an optimized amplitude mask placed a few hundred micrometers above the sensor and an efficient algorithm that can convert a single frame of captured sensor data into high-resolution 3D images. The result is FlatScope: perhaps the world's tiniest and lightest microscope. FlatScope is a lensless microscope that is scarcely larger than an image sensor (roughly 0.2 g in weight and less than 1 mm thick) and yet able to produce micrometer-resolution, high\textendash{}frame rate, 3D fluorescence movies covering a total volume of several cubic millimeters. The ability of FlatScope to reconstruct full 3D images from a single frame of captured sensor data allows us to image 3D volumes roughly 40,000 times faster than a laser scanning confocal microscope while providing comparable resolution. We envision that this new flat fluorescence microscopy paradigm will lead to implantable endoscopes that minimize tissue damage, arrays of imagers that cover large areas, and bendable, flexible microscopes that conform to complex topographies.

  abstract = {In most biological tissues, light scattering due to small differences in refractive index limits the depth of optical imaging systems. Two-photon microscopy (2PM), which significantly reduces the scattering of the excitation light, has emerged as the most common method to image deep within scattering biological tissue. This technique, however, requires high-power pulsed lasers that are both expensive and difficult to integrate into compact portable systems. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques, we show that if the excitation path length can be minimized, selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) can image nearly as deep as 2PM without the need for a high-powered pulsed laser. Compared to other single-photon imaging techniques like epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, SPIM can image more than twice as deep in scattering media ($<$inline-formula$>$ $<$mml:math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"$>$ $<$mml:mrow$>$ $<$mml:mo form="prefix"$>\sim{}<$/mml:mo$>$ $<$mml:mn$>$10$<$/mml:mn$>$ $<$/mml:mrow$>$ $<$/mml:math$>$ $<$/inline-formula$>$ times the mean scattering length).

  abstract = {Patterned illumination using a digital micromirror device (DMD) is a powerful tool for optogenetics. Compared to a scanning laser, DMDs are inexpensive and can easily create complex illumination patterns. Combining these complex spatiotemporal illumination patterns with optogenetics allows DMD-equipped microscopes to probe neural circuits by selectively manipulating the activity of many individual cells or many subcellular regions at the same time. To use DMDs to study neural activity, scientists must develop specialized software to coordinate optical stimulation patterns with the acquisition of electrophysiological and fluorescence data. To meet this growing need we have developed an open source optical pattern generation software for neuroscience - NeuroPG - that combines, DMD control, sample visualization, and data acquisition in one application. Built on a MATLAB platform, NeuroPG can also process, analyze, and visualize data. The software is designed specifically for the Mightex Polygon400; however, as an open source package, NeuroPG can be modified to incorporate any data acquisition, imaging, or illumination equipment that is compatible with MATLAB's Data Acquisition and Image Acquisition toolboxes.},

Unlike a traditional, lens-based camera, where an image of the scene is directly recorded on the sensor pixels, each pixel in FlatCam records a linear combination of light from multiple scene elements. A computational algorithm is then used to demultiplex the recorded measurements and reconstruct an image of the scene. FlatCam is an instance of a coded aperture imaging system; however, unlike the vast majority of related work, we place the coded mask extremely close to the image sensor that enables thin and flat form-factor imaging devices. We employ a separable mask to ensure that both calibration and image reconstruction are scalable in terms of memory requirements and computational complexity. We demonstrate the potential of the FlatCam design using two prototypes: one at visible wavelengths and one at infrared wavelengths.},

The framework is generalizable, but initially it emphasizes the needs of high-throughput radio astronomy pipelines, such as the ability to process data buffers as if they were continuous streams, the capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g. separate observations), and the ability to extract specific intervals from buffered data. Computing blocks in the library are designed for applications such as interferometry, pulsar dedispersion and timing, and transient search pipelines.

  abstract = {A focus on novel, confirmatory, and statistically significant results leads to substantial bias in the scientific literature. One type of bias, known as ``p-hacking,'' occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Adaptation refers to the general phenomenon that the neural system dynamically adjusts its response property according to the statistics of external inputs. In response to an invariant stimulation, neuronal firing rates first increase dramatically and then decrease gradually to a low level close to the background activity. This prompts a question: during the adaptation, how does the neural system encode the repeated stimulation with attenuated firing rates? It has been suggested that the neural system may employ a dynamical encoding strategy during the adaptation, the information of stimulus is mainly encoded by the strong independent spiking of neurons at the early stage of the adaptation; while the weak but synchronized activity of neurons encodes the stimulus information at the later stage of the adaptation. The previous study demonstrated that short-term facilitation (STF) of electrical synapses, which increases the synchronization between neurons, can provide a mechanism to realize dynamical encoding. In the present study, we further explore whether short-term plasticity (STP) of chemical synapses, an interaction form more common than electrical synapse in the cortex, can support dynamical encoding. We build a large-size network with chemical synapses between neurons. Notably, facilitation of chemical synapses only enhances pair-wise correlations between neurons mildly, but its effect on increasing synchronization of the network can be significant, and hence it can serve as a mechanism to convey the stimulus information. To read-out the stimulus information, we consider that a downstream neuron receives balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the network, so that the downstream neuron only responds to synchronized firings of the network. Therefore, the response of the downstream neuron indicates the presence of the repeated stimulation. Overall, our study demonstrates that STP of chemical synapse can serve as a mechanism to realize dynamical neural encoding. We believe that our study shed lights on the mechanism underlying the efficient neural information processing via adaptation.},

  abstract = {The study of correlations in neural circuits of different size, from the small size of cortical microcolumns to the large-scale organization of distributed networks studied with functional imaging, is a topic of central importance to systems neuroscience. However, a theory that explains how the parameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the underlying correlation structure is still missing. Here we consider a theory that can be applied to networks of arbitrary size with multiple populations of homogeneous fully-connected neurons, and we focus its analysis to a case of two populations of small size. We combine the analysis of local bifurcations of the dynamics of these networks with the analytical calculation of their cross-correlations. We study the correlation structure in different regimes, showing that a variation of the external stimuli causes the network to switch from asynchronous states, characterized by weak correlation and low variability, to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and wide temporal fluctuations. We show that asynchronous states are generated by strong stimuli, while synchronous states occur through critical slowing down when the stimulus moves the network close to a local bifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly negative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous symmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations. These results show how the correlation structure of firing-rate network models is strongly modulated by the external stimuli, even keeping the anatomical connections fixed. These results also suggest an effective mechanism through which biological networks may dynamically modulate the encoding and integration of sensory information.},

  abstract = {The role of correlations in the activity of neural populations responding to a set of stimuli can be studied within an information theory framework. Regardless of whether one approaches the problem from an encoding or decoding perspective, the main measures used to study the role of correlations can be derived from a common source: the expansion of the mutual information. Two main formalisms of mutual information expansion have been proposed: the series expansion and the exact breakdown. Here we clarify that these two formalisms have a different representation of autocorrelations, so that even when the total information estimated differs by less than 1\%, individual terms can diverge. More precisely, the series expansion explicitly evaluates the informational contribution of autocorrelations in the count of spikes, that is, count autocorrelations, whereas the exact breakdown does not. We propose a new formalism of mutual information expansion, the Poisson exact breakdown, which introduces Poisson equivalents in order to explicitly evaluate the informational contribution of count autocorrelations with no approximation involved. Because several widely employed manipulations of spike trains, most notably binning and pooling, alter the structure of count autocorrelations, the new formalism can provide a useful general framework for studying the role of correlations in population codes.},

  abstract = {A key issue in understanding the neural code for an ensemble of neurons is the nature and strength of correlations between neurons and how these correlations are related to the stimulus. The issue is complicated by the fact that there is not a single notion of independence or lack of correlation. We distinguish three kinds: (1) activity independence; (2) conditional independence; and (3) information independence. Each notion is related to an information measure: the information between cells, the information between cells given the stimulus, and the synergy of cells about the stimulus, respectively. We show that these measures form an interrelated framework for evaluating contributions of signal and noise correlations to the joint information conveyed about the stimulus and that at least two of the three measures must be calculated to characterize a population code. This framework is compared with others recently proposed in the literature. In addition, we distinguish questions about how information is encoded by a population of neurons from how that information can be decoded. Although information theory is natural and powerful for questions of encoding, it is not sufficient for characterizing the process of decoding. Decoding fundamentally requires an error measure that quantifies the importance of the deviations of estimated stimuli from actual stimuli. Because there is no a priori choice of error measure, questions about decoding cannot be put on the same level of generality as for encoding.},

  title = {The Effects of Spontaneous Activity, Background Noise, and the Stimulus Ensemble on Information Transfer in Neurons},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {0954-898X},
  abstract = {Information theory is playing an increasingly important role in the analysis of neural data as it can precisely quantify the reliability of stimulus-response functions. Estimating the mutual information between a neural spike train and a time varying stimulus is, however, not trivial in practice and requires assumptions about the specific computations being performed by the neuron under study. Consequently, estimates of the mutual information depend on these assumptions and their validity must be ascertained in the particular physiological context in which experiments are carried out. Here we compare results obtained using different information measures that make different assumptions about the neural code (i.e. the way information is being encoded and decoded) and the stimulus ensemble (i.e. the set of stimuli that the animal can encounter in nature). Our comparisons are carried out in the context of spontaneously active neurons. However, some of our results are also applicable to neurons that are not spontaneously active. We first show conditions under which a single stimulus provides a good sample of the entire stimulus ensemble. Furthermore, we use a recently introduced information measure that is based on the spontaneous activity of the neuron rather than on the stimulus ensemble. This measure is compared to the Shannon information and it is shown that the two differ only by a constant. This constant is shown to represent the information that the neuron's spontaneous activity transmits about the fact that no stimulus is present in the animal's environment. As a consequence, the mutual information measure based on spontaneous activity is easily applied to stimuli that mimic those seen in nature, as it does not require a priori knowledge of the stimulus ensemble. Finally, we consider the effect of noise in the animal's environment on information transmission about sensory stimuli. Our results show that, as expected, such 'background' noise will increase the trial-to-trial variability of the neural response to repeated presentations of a stimulus. However, the same background noise can also increase the variability of the spike train and hence can lead to increased information transfer in the presence of background noise. Our study emphasizes how different assumptions can lead to different predictions for the information transmission of a neuron. Assumptions about the computations being performed by the system under study as well as the stimulus ensemble and background noise should therefore be carefully considered when applying information theory.},

In many brain systems, neurons with "pure" tuning to one stimulus dimension are found along with "conjunctive" neurons that encode several dimensions, forming an apparently redundant representation. Here we show using theoretical analysis that a mixed-dimensionality code can efficiently represent a stimulus in different behavioral regimes: encoding by conjunctive cells is more robust when the stimulus changes quickly, whereas on long timescales pure cells represent the stimulus more efficiently with fewer neurons. We tested our predictions experimentally in the bat head-direction system and found that many head-direction cells switched their tuning dynamically from pure to conjunctive representation as a function of angular velocity-confirming our theoretical prediction. More broadly, our results suggest that optimal dimensionality depends on population size and on the time available for decoding-which might explain why mixed-dimensionality representations are common in sensory, motor, and higher cognitive systems across species.},

In this article, we walk through the mathematics of information theory along with common logistical problems associated with data type, data binning, data quantity requirements, bias, and significance testing. Next, we analyze models inspired by canonical neuroscience experiments to improve understanding and demonstrate the strengths of information theory analyses.

This is, to our knowledge, the first tool for medical data analysis that provides both high performance and rapid prototyping. As such, it has the potential to act as a force multiplier for further research, enabling handling of high-resolution datasets while providing quasi-instant feedback and visualization of results.},

  abstract = {Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and the objective grading is of great importance for treatment. This paper presents an automatic computer-aided diagnosis of gliomas that combines automatic segmentation and radiomics, which can improve the diagnostic ability. The MRI data containing 220 high-grade gliomas and 54 low-grade gliomas are used to evaluate our system. A multiscale 3D convolutional neural network is trained to segment whole tumor regions. A wide range of radiomic features including first-order features, shape features, and texture features is extracted. By using support vector machines with recursive feature elimination for feature selection, a CAD system that has an extreme gradient boosting classifier with a 5-fold cross-validation is constructed for the grading of gliomas. Our CAD system is highly effective for the grading of gliomas with an accuracy of 91.27\%, a weighted macroprecision of 91.27\%, a weighted macrorecall of 91.27\%, and a weighted macro-1 score of 90.64\%. This demonstrates that the proposed CAD system can assist radiologists for high accurate grading of gliomas and has the potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Chronic cranial windows have been instrumental in advancing optical studies in vivo, permitting long-term, high-resolution imaging in various brain regions. However, once a window is attached it is difficult to regain access to the brain under the window for cellular manipulations. Here we describe a simple device that combines long term in vivo optical imaging with direct brain access via glass or quartz pipettes and metal, glass, or quartz electrodes for cellular manipulations like dye or drug injections and electrophysiological stimulations or recordings while keeping the craniotomy sterile. Our device comprises a regular cranial window glass coverslip with a drilled access hole later sealed with biocompatible silicone. This chronic cranial window with access port is cheap, easy to manufacture, can be mounted just as the regular chronic cranial window, and is self-sealing after retraction of the pipette or electrode. We demonstrate that multiple injections can be performed through the silicone port by repetitively bolus loading calcium sensitive dye into mouse barrel cortex and recording spontaneous cellular activity over a period of weeks. As an example to the extent of its utility for electrophysiological recording, we describe how simple removal of the silicone seal can permit patch pipette access for whole-cell patch clamp recordings in vivo. During these chronic experiments we do not observe any infections under the window or impairment of animal health.},

  abstract = {Traditional small molecule voltage sensitive dye indicators have been a powerful tool for monitoring large scale dynamics of neuronal activities but have several limitations including the lack of cell class specific targeting, invasiveness and difficulties in conducting longitudinal studies. Recent advances in the development of genetically-encoded voltage indicators have successfully overcome these limitations. Genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) provide sufficient sensitivity to map cortical representations of sensory information and spontaneous network activities across cortical areas and different brain states. In this study, we directly compared the performance of a prototypic GEVI, VSFP2.3, with that of a widely used small molecule voltage sensitive dye (VSD), RH1691, in terms of their ability to resolve mesoscopic scale cortical population responses. We used three synchronized CCD cameras to simultaneously record the dual emission ratiometric fluorescence signal from VSFP2.3 and RH1691 fluorescence. The results show that VSFP2.3 offers more stable and less invasive recording conditions, while the signal-to-noise level and the response dynamics to sensory inputs are comparable to RH1691 recordings.},

We performed quantitative analyses of spontaneous animal behaviour, the associated network states and the cellular activities in the dorsal hippocampus as well as estimated the brain stability limits to image dendritic processes and individual axonal boutons. Ca2+ imaging recordings revealed a relatively stereotyped hippocampal activity despite a high inter-animal and inter-day variability in the mouse behavior. In addition to quiet state and locomotion behavioural patterns, the platform allowed the reliable detection of walking steps and fine speed variations. The brain motion during locomotion was limited to \textasciitilde{}1.8 $\mu$m, thus allowing for imaging of small sub-cellular structures to be performed in parallel with recordings of network and behavioural states. This simple device extends the drug-free experimentation in vivo, enabling high-stability optophysiological experiments with single-bouton resolution in the mouse awake brain.},

  shorttitle = {{{StimDuino}}},
  abstract = {Background
Electrical stimulus isolator is a widely used device in electrophysiology. The timing of the stimulus application is usually automated and controlled by the external device or acquisition software; however, the intensity of the stimulus is adjusted manually. Inaccuracy, lack of reproducibility and no automation of the experimental protocol are disadvantages of the manual adjustment. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed StimDuino, an inexpensive Arduino-controlled stimulus isolator allowing highly accurate, reproducible automated setting of the stimulation current.
New method
The intensity of the stimulation current delivered by StimDuino is controlled by Arduino, an open-source microcontroller development platform. The automatic stimulation patterns are software-controlled and the parameters are set from Matlab-coded simple, intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. The software also allows remote control of the device over the network.
Results
Electrical current measurements showed that StimDuino produces the requested current output with high accuracy. In both hippocampal slice and in vivo recordings, the fEPSP measurements obtained with StimDuino and the commercial stimulus isolators showed high correlation.
Comparison with existing methods
Commercial stimulus isolators are manually managed, while StimDuino generates automatic stimulation patterns with increasing current intensity. The pattern is utilized for the input\textendash{}output relationship analysis, necessary for assessment of excitability. In contrast to StimuDuino, not all commercial devices are capable for remote control of the parameters and stimulation process.
Conclusions
StimDuino-generated automation of the input\textendash{}output relationship assessment eliminates need for the current intensity manually adjusting, improves stimulation reproducibility, accuracy and allows on-site and remote control of the stimulation parameters.},

  abstract = {Direct volume rendering has become an essential tool to explore and analyse 3D medical images. Despite several advances in the field, it remains a challenge to produce an image that highlights the anatomy of interest, avoids occlusion of important structures, provides an intuitive perception of shape and depth while retaining sufficient contextual information. Although the computer graphics community has proposed several solutions to address specific visualization problems, the medical imaging community still lacks a general volume rendering implementation that can address a wide variety of visualization use cases while avoiding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new open source framework called the Programmable Ray Integration Shading Model, or PRISM, that implements a complete GPU ray-casting solution where critical parts of the ray integration algorithm can be replaced to produce new volume rendering effects. A graphical user interface allows clinical users to easily experiment with pre-existing rendering effect building blocks drawn from an open database. For programmers, the interface enables real-time editing of the code inside the blocks. We show that in its default mode, the PRISM framework produces images very similar to those produced by a widely-adopted direct volume rendering implementation in VTK at comparable frame rates. More importantly, we demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by showing how several volume rendering techniques can be implemented in PRISM with no more than a few lines of code. Finally, we demonstrate the simplicity of our system in a usability study with 5 medical imaging expert subjects who have none or little experience with volume rendering. The PRISM framework has the potential to greatly accelerate development of volume rendering for medical applications by promoting sharing and enabling faster development iterations and easier collaboration between engineers and clinical personnel.},

  shorttitle = {Porcupine},
  abstract = {The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one's analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one's analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

  abstract = {Three types of highly-customizable open source probe positioning systems are evaluated: (a) mostly 3-D printed, (b) partially printed using OpenBeam kinematic constraints, and (c) a 3-level stack of low-cost commercial single axis micropositioners and some printed parts. All systems use digital distributed manufacturing to enable bespoke features, which can be fabricated with RepRap-class 3-D printer and easily accessible components. They are all flexible in material choice for custom components. The micropositioners can be set up for left-right use and flat or recessed configurations using either mechanical or magnetic mounting. All systems use a manual probe holder that can be customized and enable a quick swap probe system. System (a) is purchased for \$100 or fabricated for $<$\$5, (b) fabricated for \$25, and (c) fabricated for \$145. Each full turn of a knob moves an axis 0.8 mm for (a) and 0.5 mm for (b, c) providing externally measured positional control of 10 $\mathrm{\mu}$m for the latter. All three designs can utilize a customizable probe holder and tungsten carbide needle for \$56. The designs are validated using microchips with known feature sizes and underwent mechanical stress tests. The maximal deflection of (a) was $>$200 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, (b) 40 $\mathrm{\mu}$m and (c) 10 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. A tradeoff is observed for 3-D printed percent between cost and accuracy. All systems provided substantial cost savings over proprietary products with similar functionality.},

  abstract = {Two-photon laser scanning microscopy has revolutionized the ability to delineate cellular and physiological function in acutely isolated tissue and in vivo. However, there exist barriers for many laboratories to acquire two-photon microscopes. Additionally, if owned, typical systems are difficult to modify to rapidly evolving methodologies. A potential solution to these problems is to enable scientists to build their own high-performance and adaptable system by overcoming a resource insufficiency. Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope that can be used for in vitro or in vivo applications. The microscope is comprised of high-end componentry on a skeleton of off-the-shelf compatible opto-mechanical parts. The dedicated design enabled imaging depths close to 1 mm into mouse brain tissue and a signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded all commercial two-photon systems tested. In addition to a detailed parts list, instructions for assembly, testing and troubleshooting, our plan includes complete three dimensional computer models that greatly reduce the knowledge base required for the non-expert user. This open-source resource lowers barriers in order to equip more laboratories with high-performance two-photon imaging and to help progress our understanding of the cellular and physiological function of living systems.},

  abstract = {A technology to record membrane potential from multiple neurons, simultaneously, in behaving animals will have a transformative impact on neuroscience research. Parallel recordings could reveal the subthreshold potentials and intercellular correlations that underlie network behavior. Paired stimulation and recording can further reveal the input-output properties of individual cells or networks in the context of different brain states. Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for these purposes, but were so far limited to single-cell recordings with marginal signal to noise ratio (SNR) in vivo. We developed improved near infrared voltage indicators, high speed microscopes and targeted gene expression schemes which enabled recordings of supra- and subthreshold voltage dynamics from multiple neurons simultaneously in mouse hippocampus, in vivo. The reporters revealed sub-cellular details of back-propagating action potentials, correlations in sub-threshold voltage between multiple cells, and changes in dynamics associated with transitions from resting to locomotion. In combination with optogenetic stimulation, the reporters revealed brain state-dependent changes in neuronal excitability, reflecting the interplay of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. These tools open the possibility for detailed explorations of network dynamics in the context of behavior.},

Optogenetics is one large step toward achieving this goal, yet optical methods to control neural activity in behaving rodents have so far been limited to perturbing all light-sensitive neurons in a large volume. Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with computer-generated holography, were transmitted to the mouse brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity. The fiberscope was tested in mice coexpressing ChR2-tdTomato and GCaMP5-G in cerebellar interneurons, delivering near-cellular resolution photoactivation in freely behaving mice.},

We use results from a computational model of the Parkinsonian basal ganglia to illustrate general issues relevant to eventual clinical or experimental tests of such an algorithm. Specifically, while the relationship between DBS characteristics and performance is highly complex, global search methods appear able to identify novel and effective waveforms with convergence rates that are acceptably fast to merit further investigation in laboratory or clinical settings.},

This combination of properties is unavailable through any other material solution. The concept uses two constituents configured as adjoining sub-lattices. It accommodates the thermal expansion through rotation of the members of one sub-lattice. Moreover, the lattice exhibits large stiffness to weight because it is fully triangulated and does not rely on rotational resistance at the joints for structural rigidity. A wide range of constituents can be used to build the new lattices enabling many desirable properties to be incorporated, especially high strength and toughness. Examples of both planar and volumetric lattices are presented, and their thermo-mechanical properties derived. The results are verified by conducting experiments and finite element simulations on a lattice fabricated using aluminium and titanium alloy constituents. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Its probabilistic basis and capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for studying information flow in the nervous system. As a framework it has a number of useful properties: it provides a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only linear effects; its quantities have meaningful units which in many cases allow direct comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much information can be gained by observing neural responses in single experimental trials, rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - including the Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and mutual information. In this entry, we introduce and define these quantities. Further details on how these quantities can be estimated in practice are provided in the entry "Estimation of Information-Theoretic Quantities" and examples of application of these techniques in neuroscience can be found in the entry "Applications of Information-Theoretic Quantities in Neuroscience".},

This gives hope to a substantial percentage of therapy\textendash{}resistant psychiatric patients requiring new therapy approaches. There are no fundamental ethic objections to its use in psychiatric disorders, but until substantial clinical data is available, mandatory standards are needed. \{DBS\} is a unique and very promising method for the treatment of therapy\textendash{}resistant psychiatric patients.

  abstract = {Background: Variability in brain tissue volumes derived from magnetic resonance images is attributable to various sources. In quantitative comparisons it is therefore crucial to distinguish between biologically and methodically conditioned variance and to take spatial accordance into account. New method: We introduce volume transition analysis as a method that not only provides details on numerical and spatial accordance of tissue volumes in repeated scans but also on voxel shifts between tissue types. Based on brain tissue probability maps, mono- and bidirectional voxel shifts can be examined by explicitly separating volume transitions into source and target. We apply the approach to a set of subject data from repeated intra-scanner (one week and 30month interval) as well as inter-scanner measurements. Results: In all measurement scenarios, we found similar inter-class transitions of 9.9-15.9\% of intracranial volume. The percentage of monodirectional net volume transition however increases from 0.3\% in short term intra-scanner to 1.6\% in long term intra-scanner and 9.3\% in inter-scanner comparisons. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike most routinely used variability measures volume transition analysis is able to monitor reclassifications and thus to quantify not only balanced flows but also the amount of monodirectional net flows between tissue classes. The approach is independent from group analysis and can thus be applied in as few as two images. Conclusions: The proposed method is an easily applicable tool that is useful in discovering intra-individual brain changes and assists in separating biological from technical variance in structural brain measures.},

Our measures are motivated by an operational idea of unique information, which suggests that shared information and unique information should depend only on the marginal distributions of the pairs (X, Y) and (X,Z). Although this invariance property has not been studied before, it is satisfied by other proposed measures of shared information. The invariance property does not uniquely determine our new measures, but it implies that the functions that we define are bounds to any other measures satisfying the same invariance property. We study properties of our measures and compare them to other candidate measures.},

It plays an important role in the connectivity and integration of computerized machines, such as sensors, actu- ators, controllers, and robots. The requirements in flexibility, efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility of the intermodule communication between the connected machines raise chal- lenges for the M2M messaging mechanism toward ubiquitous data access and events notification. This investigation determines the challenges facing the M2M communication of industrial systems and presents a data-oriented M2M messaging mech- anism based on ZeroMQ for the ubiquitous data access in rich sensing pervasive industrial applications. To prove the fea- sibility of the proposed solution, the EU funded PickNPack production line with a reference industrial network architec- ture is presented, and the communication between a microwave sensor device and the quality assessment and sensing mod- ule controller of the PickNPack line is illustrated as a case study. The evaluation is carried out through qualitative anal- ysis and experimental studies, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed messaging mechanism. Due to the flexibility in dealing with hierarchical system architecture and cross-platform heterogeneity of industrial applications, this mes- saging mechanism deserves extensive investigations and further evaluations.},

The Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI) is an open source software platform for achieving hard real-time data acquisition and closed-loop control in biological experiments while retaining the flexibility needed for experimental settings. RTXI has enabled users to implement complex custom closed-loop protocols in single cell, cell network, animal, and human electrophysiology studies. RTXI is also used as a free and open source, customizable electrophysiology platform in open-loop studies requiring online data acquisition, processing, and visualization.

A motivating example is a problem of tracking multiple interacting nanoparticles imaged on video frames, where particles can aggregate into one particle or a particle can be split into multiple particles. Many existing multitarget tracking methods are capable of tracking non-interacting targets or tracking interacting targets of restricted degrees of interactions. The proposed formulation solves a multitarget tracking problem for general degrees of inter-object interactions. The formulation is in the form of a binary integer programming problem. We propose a polynomial time solution approach that can obtain a good relaxation solution of the binary integer programming, so the approach can be applied for multitarget tracking problems of a moderate size (for hundreds of targets over tens of time frames). The resulting solution is always integral and obtains a better duality gap than the simple linear relaxation solution of the corresponding problem. The proposed method was validated through applications to simulated multitarget tracking problems and a real multitarget tracking problem.},

  abstract = {High frequency deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (deep brain stimulation, DBS) relieves many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in humans and animal models. Although the treatment has seen widespread use, its therapeutic mechanism remains paradoxical. The subthalamic nucleus is excitatory, so its stimulation at rates higher than its normal firing rate should worsen the disease by increasing subthalamic excitation of the globus pallidus. The therapeutic effectiveness of DBS is also frequency and intensity sensitive, and the stimulation must be periodic; aperiodic stimulation at the same mean rate is ineffective. These requirements are not adequately explained by existing models, whether based on firing rate changes or on reduced bursting. Here we report modeling studies suggesting that high frequency periodic excitation of the subthalamic nucleus may act by desynchronizing the firing of neurons in the globus pallidus, rather than by changing the firing rate or pattern of individual cells. Globus pallidus neurons are normally desynchronized, but their activity becomes correlated in Parkinson's disease. Periodic stimulation may induce chaotic desynchronization by interacting with the intrinsic oscillatory mechanism of globus pallidus neurons. Our modeling results suggest a mechanism of action of DBS and a pathophysiology of Parkinsonism in which synchrony, rather than firing rate, is the critical pathological feature.},

  abstract = {This study presents the motion control of a real time two wheeled balance robot capable of moving back and forward, turning right and left and video streaming via IP (Internet Protocol) camera on it. A C++ based visual user interface is created on PC (Personal Computer) in order to control of the designed Two Wheeled Mobile Balance Robot (TWMBR). By means of the interface, all controller parameters of the robot can be changed via wireless communication module on it. Moreover, the robot's tilt angle with respect to time, linear displacement and controller output can be observed simultaneously. Within the robot control interface, the videos from IP camera is transferred into the operator screen via TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. So, the robot can be controlled via arrow keys and visual interface on PC remotely by an operator. Acceleration and gyro sensors are fused by means of a real-time Kalman Filter so that robot can keep its balance in both moving and stable state in the designed system. Thus, an accurate tilt angle control is realized. Classic PID (Proportional-Integral- Derivative) algorithm is used as robot controller. In conclusion, via IP camera on the robot, the real-time motion control is performed and data diagrams about motion control are obtained.},

  doi = {10.1038/nprot.2016.158},
  abstract = {Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISI) is a rapid and noninvasive method for observing brain activity in vivo over a large area of the cortex. Here we describe our protocol for mapping retinotopy to identify mouse visual cortical areas using ISI. First, surgery is performed to attach a head frame to the mouse skull (\~1 h). The next day, intrinsic activity across the visual cortex is recorded during the presentation of a full-field drifting bar in the horizontal and vertical directions (\~2 h). Horizontal and vertical retinotopic maps are generated by analyzing the response of each pixel during the period of the stimulus. Last, an algorithm uses these retinotopic maps to compute the visual field sign and coverage, and automatically construct visual borders without human input. Compared with conventional retinotopic mapping with episodic presentation of adjacent stimuli, a continuous, periodic stimulus is more resistant to biological artifacts. Furthermore, unlike manual hand-drawn approaches, we present a method for automatically segmenting visual areas, even in the small mouse cortex. This relatively simple procedure and accompanying open-source code can be implemented with minimal surgical and computational experience, and is useful to any laboratory wishing to target visual cortical areas in this increasingly valuable model system.},

This article shows how to analyze neural systems using information theory with the aim of obtaining constraints that help to identify the algorithms run by neural systems and the information they represent. Algorithms and representations identified this way may then guide the design of biologically inspired computing systems. The material covered includes the necessary introduction to information theory and to the estimation of information theoretic quantities from neural recordings. We then show how to analyze the information encoded in a system about its environment, and also discuss recent methodological developments on the question of how much information each agent carries about the environment either uniquely, or redundantly or synergistically together with others. Last, we introduce the framework of local information dynamics, where information processing is partitioned into component processes of information storage, transfer, and modification -- locally in space and time. We close by discussing example applications of these measures to neural data and other complex systems.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to understand how spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal electrical activity underlie brain function, from sensory representations to decision making. An emerging technology for monitoring electrical dynamics, voltage imaging using genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), couples the power of genetics with the advantages of light. Here, we review the properties that determine indicator performance and applicability, discussing both recent progress and technical limitations. We then consider GEVI applications, highlighting studies that have already deployed GEVIs for biological discovery. We also examine which classes of biological questions GEVIs are primed to address and which ones are beyond their current capabilities. As GEVIs are further developed, we anticipate that they will become more broadly used by the neuroscience community to eavesdrop on brain activity with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetically encoded voltage indicators are engineered light-emitting protein sensors that typically report neuronal voltage dynamics as changes in brightness. In this review, we systematically discuss the current state of this emerging method, considering both its advantages and limitations for imaging neural activity. We also present recent applications of this technology and discuss what is feasible now and what we anticipate will become possible with future indicator development. This review will inform neuroscientists of recent progress in the field and help potential users critically evaluate the suitability of genetically encoded voltage indicator imaging to answer their specific biological questions.},

Each device com-bines one broadband photodiode (visible plus infrared) and one infrared-responding photodiode on a single CMOS integrated circuit capable of providing a near-photopic response over an effective 20-bit dynamic range (16-bit resolution). Two integrating ADCs convert the photodiode currents to a digital output that represents the irradiance measured on each channel. This digital output can be input to a microprocessor where illuminance (ambient light level) in lux is derived using an empirical formula to approximate the human eye response. The TSL2560 device permits an SMB-Alert style interrupt, and the TSL2561 device supports a traditional level style interrupt that remains asserted until the firmware clears it. While useful for general purpose light sensing applications, the TSL2560/61 devices are designed particularly for display panels (LCD, OLED, etc.) with the purpose of extending battery life and providing optimum viewing in diverse lighting conditions. Display panel backlighting, which can account for up to 30 to 40 percent of total platform power, can be automatically managed. Both devices are also ideal for controlling keyboard illumination based upon ambient lighting conditions. Illuminance information can further be used to manage exposure control in digital cameras. The TSL2560/61 devices are ideal in notebook/tablet PCs, LCD monitors, flat-panel televisions, cell phones, and digital cameras. In addition, other applications include street light control, security lighting, sunlight harvesting, machine vision, and automotive instrumentation clusters. r},

  abstract = {Effective estimation of the salience of environmental stimuli underlies adaptive behavior, while related aberrance is believed to undermine rational thought processes in schizophrenia. A network including bilateral frontoinsular cortex (FIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been observed to respond to salient stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test the hypothesis that activity in this salience network (SN) is less discriminately modulated by contextually-relevant stimuli in schizophrenia than in healthy individuals, fMRI data were collected in 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 13 matched controls during performance of a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task. After quantitatively identifying spatial components representative of the FIC and dACC features of the SN, two principal analyses were conducted. In the first, modulation of SN activity by salience was assessed by measuring response to trial outcome. First-level general linear models were applied to individual-specific time-courses of SN activity identified using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). This analysis revealed a significant salience-by-performance-by-group interaction on the best-fit FIC component's activity at trial outcome, whereby healthy individuals but not individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater distinction between the response to hits and misses in high salience trials than in low salience trials. The second analysis aimed to ascertain whether SN component amplitude differed between the study groups over the duration of the experiment. Independent-samples T-tests on back-projected, percent-signal-change scaled SN component images importantly showed that the groups did not differ in the overall amplitude of SN expression over the entire dataset. These findings of dysregulated but not decreased SN activity in schizophrenia provide physiological support for mechanistic conceptual frameworks of delusional thought formation.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

This synchrony preferentially occurs over 10\textendash{}30 Hz, the so-called beta band. Correlative evidence has been supplemented by experiments in which direct stimulation of the basal ganglia in the beta band slows movement. Yet questions remain regarding the small scale of the latter effects and whether synchrony is an early or even obligatory feature of parkinsonism. Nevertheless, the principle that abnormally synchronised activity in the beta band can disrupt the function finds a precedent in the syndrome of cortical myoclonus. Here, pathologically synchronised discharges of pyramidal neurons are transmitted to the healthy spinal cord. The result is the synchronous discharge of motor units leading to rhythmic jerking.},

We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature.},

In the paper the most often used Ultrametric Distance (UD) is compared with the Manhattan Distance (MD). It is showed that MD allows to investigate a broader class of correlation and is more robust to the noise influence. Therefore MD was used to construct entropy distance, which is applied to the analysis of correlation between subset of WIG20 and S\&P500 companies. In the analysis three network structures were used: minimum spanning tree and unidirectional and bidirectional minimum length path. The results are compared to the standard UD based analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of the analysed time series distances are outlined.},

Two signals are considered similar if one can be compressed significantly when the information of the other is known. The existing compression-based similarity methods, although successful in the discrete one dimensional domain, do not work well in the context of images. This paper proposes a sparse representation-based approach to encode the information content of an image using information from the other image, and uses the compactness (sparsity) of the representation as a measure of its compressibility (how much can the image be compressed) with respect to the other image. The more sparse the representation of an image, the better it can be compressed and the more it is similar to the other image. The efficacy of the proposed measure is demonstrated through the high accuracies achieved in image clustering, retrieval and classification.},

Results are presented for mouse adult and embryonic NPCs from hundreds of clones, or lineage trees, containing tens of thousands of cells and millions of segmentations. New visualization approaches allow the NPC nuclear and process features to be effectively visualized for an entire clone. Significant differences in process and nuclear dynamics were found among type A and type C adult NPCs, and also between embryonic NPCs cultured from the anterior and posterior cerebral cortex.},

Our goal is to compute camera paths that are composed of constant, linear and parabolic segments mimicking the camera motions employed by professional cinematographers. To this end, our algorithm is based on a linear programming framework to minimize the first, second, and third derivatives of the resulting camera path. Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos. Our approach accomplishes this without the need of user interaction or costly 3D reconstruction of the scene, and works as a post-process for videos from any camera or from an online source.},

  abstract = {Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently been shown to be effective for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, there are many limitations of the current technology: the large size of current microelectrodes ($\sim$1mm diameter); the lack of monitoring of local brain electrical activity and neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine in Parkinson's disease); the open-loop nature of the stimulation (i.e. not guided by brain electrochemical activity). Reducing the size of the monitoring and stimulating electrodes by orders of magnitude (to the size of neural elements) allows remarkable improvements in both monitoring (spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and sensitivity) and stimulation. Carbon nanofiber nanoelectrode technology offers the possibility of trimodal arrays (monitoring electrical activity, monitoring neurotransmitter levels, precise stimulation). DBS can then be guided by changes in brain electrical activity and/or neurotransmitter levels (i.e. closed-loop DBS). Here, we describe the basic manufacture and electrical characteristics of a prototype nanoelectrode array for DBS, as well as preliminary studies with electroconductive polymers necessary to optimize DBS in vivo. An approach such as the nanoelectrode array described here may offer a generic electrical-neural interface for use in various neural prostheses.},

The most common method for targeting stereoscopic injections uses the skull indentations bregma and lambda as reference points and is limited in its precision by factors such as skull curvature and individual variation, as well as an incomplete correspondence between skull landmarks and brain locations. In this software tool, a 3D laser scan of the mouse skull is taken in vitro and registered onto a reference skull using a point cloud matching algorithm, and the parameters of the transformation are used to position a glass pipette to place tracer injections. The software was capable of registering sample skulls with less than 100 micron error, and was able to target an injection in a mouse with error of roughly 500 microns. These results indicate that using skull scan registration has the potential to be widely applicable in automating stereotactic targeting of tracer injections.},

Despite over a century of research into these lesions, the exact relationship between pathology and neurotoxicity has yet to be fully elucidated. In order to study the formation of plaques and tangles and their effects on the brain, we have applied multiphoton in vivo imaging of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. This technique allows longitudinal imaging of pathological aggregation of proteins and the subsequent changes in surrounding neuropil neurodegeneration and recovery after therapeutic interventions.},

We discuss recent progress and future directions for imaging in behaving mammals from a systems engineering perspective, which seeks holistic consideration of fluorescent indicators, optical instrumentation, and computational analyses. Today, genetically encoded indicators of neural Casup2+/sup dynamics are widely used, and those of trans-membrane voltage are rapidly improving. Two complementary imaging paradigms involve conventional microscopes for studying head-restrained animals and head-mounted miniature microscopes for imaging in freely behaving animals. Overall, the field has attained sufficient sophistication that increased cooperation between those designing new indicators, light sources, microscopes, and computational analyses would greatly benefit future progress.},

Recent improvements in high performance fluorescent sensors and scientific CMOS cameras enables optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale. While exciting technical advances demonstrate the potential of this technique, further improvement in data acquisition and analysis, especially those that allow effective processing of increasingly larger datasets, would greatly promote the application of optical imaging in systems neuroscience. Here we demonstrate the ability of wide-field imaging to capture the concurrent dynamic activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons over millimeters of brain tissue in behaving mice. This system allows the visualization of morphological details at a higher spatial resolution than has been previously achieved using similar functional imaging modalities. To analyze the expansive data sets, we developed software to facilitate rapid downstream data processing. Using this system, we show that a large fraction of anatomically distinct hippocampal neurons respond to discrete environmental stimuli associated with classical conditioning, and that the observed temporal dynamics of transient calcium signals are sufficient for exploring certain spatiotemporal features of large neural networks.},

In this study, a new model of the closed loop network is used to explore the generation and interaction of network oscillations and their suppression through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Under simulated dopamine depletion conditions, increased gain through the hyperdirect pathway resulted in the interaction of neural oscillations at different frequencies in the cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to the emergence of synchronized oscillations at a new intermediate frequency. Further increases in synaptic gain resulted in the cortex driving synchronous oscillatory activity throughout the network. When DBS was added to the model a progressive reduction in STN power at the tremor and beta frequencies was observed as the frequency of stimulation was increased, with resonance effects occurring for low frequency DBS ($\backslash$\$\{$\backslash$textless\}\$40 Hz) in agreement with experimental observations. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronous oscillations can arise within the network and how DBS may suppress unwanted oscillatory activity.},

A weighted version of HITS is applied to the overall star graph, and generates a different set of top influential repositories other than the results from standard version of HITS algorithm. We also conduct the influential analysis on per-month star graph, and study the monthly influence ranking of top repositories.},

This is a challenging task as photons, instead of traversing ballistically, propagate predominantly diffusively due to random multiple scattering off the inhomogenieties. Imaging \{$\backslash$it in real-time\} with ballistic light under continuous-wave illumination is even more challenging due to the extremely weak signal, necessitating voluminous data-processing. In this paper, we report imaging through strongly scattering media in real-time and at rates several times the critical flicker frequency of the eye, so that motion is perceived as continuous. Two factors contributed to the speedup of \{$\backslash$it more than three orders of magnitude\} over conventional techniques - the use of a simplified algorithm enabling processing of data on the fly, and the utilisation of task and data parallelization capabilities of typical desktop computers. The extreme simplicity and low cost promises great utility of this technique. As an example, navigation under poor visibility is examined.},

This paper shows that, in the case of a planar scene with a fixed calibrated camera, a set of pixels can be selected to compute the background model while ignoring the other pixels for accurate but less costly motion detection. The calibration is used to first define a volume of interest in the real world and to project the volume of interest onto the image, and to define a spatial adaptive subsampling of this region of interest with a subsampling density that depends on the camera distance. Indeed, farther objects need to be analyzed with more precision than closer objects. Tests on many video sequences have integrated this adaptive subsampling to various motion detection techniques. \textcopyright{} 2009 Tsinghua University Press.},

In such a system, a feedback signal is used to adjust automatically stimulation parameters and optimize the efficacy of stimulation. We explored the feasibility of recording electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) during DBS for use as a feedback control signal. A novel instrumentation system was developed to suppress the stimulus artifact and amplify the small magnitude, short latency ECAP response during DBS with clinically relevant parameters. In vitro testing demonstrated the capabilities to increase the gain by a factor of 1,000x over a conventional amplifier without saturation, reduce distortion of mock ECAP signals, and make high fidelity recordings of mock ECAPs at latencies of only 0.5 ms following DBS pulses of 50 to 100 $\mu$s duration. Subsequently, the instrumentation was used to make in vivo recordings of ECAPs during thalamic DBS in cats, without contamination by the stimulus artifact. The signal characteristics were similar across three experiments, suggesting common neural activation patterns. The ECAP recordings enabled with this novel instrumentation may provide insight into the type and spatial extent of neural elements activated during DBS, and could serve as feedback control signals for closed-loop systems.},

Although performance has traditionally been the challenge of this approach, this situation changes with modern server platforms. High performance load balancers, proxies, virtual switches and other network functions can be now implemented in software and not limited to specialized commercial hardware, thus reducing cost and increasing the flexibility. In this paper we design a lossless software-based switch for high bandwidth data acquisition (DAQ) networks, using the ATLAS experiment at CERN as a case study. We prove that it can effectively solve the incast pathology arising from the many-to-one communication pattern present in DAQ networks by providing extremely high buffering capabilities.

  abstract = {In order to safely navigate and orient in their local surroundings autonomous systems need to rapidly extract and persistently track visual features from the environment. While there are many algorithms tackling those tasks for traditional frame-based cameras, these have to deal with the fact that conventional cameras sample their environment with a fixed frequency. Most prominently, the same features have to be found in consecutive frames and corresponding features then need to be matched using elaborate techniques as any information between the two frames is lost. We introduce a novel method to detect and track line structures in data streams of event-based silicon retinae (also known as dynamic vision sensors, DVS). In contrast to conventional cameras, these biologically inspired sensors generate a quasi-continuous stream of vision information analogous to the information stream created by the ganglion cells in mammal retinae. All pixels of DVS operate asynchronously without a periodic sampling rate and emit a so-called DVS address event as soon as they perceive a luminance change exceeding an adjustable threshold. We use the high temporal resolution achieved by the DVS to track features continuously through time instead of only at fixed points in time. The focus of this work lies on tracking lines in a mostly static environment which is observed by a moving camera, a typical setting in mobile robotics. Since DVS events are mostly generated at object boundaries and edges which in man-made environments often form lines they were chosen as feature to track. Our method is based on detecting planes of DVS address events in x-y-t-space and tracing these planes through time. It is robust against noise and runs in real time on a standard computer, hence it is suitable for low latency robotics. The efficacy and performance are evaluated on real-world data sets which show artificial structures in an office-building using event data for tracking and frame data for ground-truth estimation from a DAVIS240C sensor.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons' neighbors \textemdash{} whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away \textemdash{} must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

Excess demand can cause ``brown outs,'' while excess supply ends in waste. In an industry worth over \$1 trillion in the U.S. alone [1], almost 9\% of GDP [2], even marginal improvements can have a huge impact. Any plan toward energy efficiency should include enhanced utilization of existing production. Energy loads provide an interesting topic for Machine Learning techniques due to the availability of large datasets that exhibit fundamental nonlinear patterns. Using data from the Kaggle competition ``Global Energy Forecasting Compe- tition 2012 - Load Forecasting'' [3] we sought to use deep learning architectures to predict energy loads across different network grid areas, using only time and temperature data. Data included hourly demand for four and a half years from 20 different geographic regions, and similar hourly temper- ature readings from 11 zones. For most of our analysis we focused on short term load forecasting because this will aide online operational scheduling.},

Methods We retrospectively analyzed hemorrhage rates of EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placement in 27 patients within 48h after coil embolization under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet schemes (heparin, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel). In patients with continuous heparin via perfusor the application was stopped periprocedurally. The results were compared to literature. Results Four hemorrhages (14.8\%) were observed. Three hemorrhages were petechial and one was by definition a larger hemorrhage with 8mm\texttimes{}10mm in diameter. Conclusions EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placements within 48h after cerebral aneurysm coiling and under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet regimens seem to have no increased risk of hemorrhages compared to literature.},

  abstract = {Recently, biologically inspired models are gradually proposed to solve the problem in text analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are hierarchical artificial neural networks, which include a various of multilayer perceptrons. According to biological research, CNN can be improved by bringing in the attention modulation and memory processing of primate visual cortex. In this paper, we employ the above properties of primate visual cortex to improve CNN and propose a biological-mechanism-driven-feature-construction based answer recommendation method (BMFC-ARM), which is used to recommend the best answer for the corresponding given questions in community question answering. BMFC-ARM is an improved CNN with four channels respectively representing questions, answers, asker information and answerer information, and mainly contains two stages: biological mechanism driven feature construction (BMFC) and answer ranking. BMFC imitates the attention modulation property by introducing the asker information and answerer information of given questions and the similarity between them, and imitates the memory processing property through bringing in the user reputation information for answerers. Then the feature vector for answer ranking is constructed by fusing the asker-answerer similarities, answerer's reputation and the corresponding vectors of question, answer, asker and answerer. Finally, the Softmax is used at the stage of answer ranking to get best answers by the feature vector. The experimental results of answer recommendation on the Stackexchange dataset show that BMFC-ARM exhibits better performance.},

The proposed architecture has five key concepts which are different from conventional reconfigurable modular service robots; 1) easy and multiple assembly according to requirements of users, 2) hardware resource sharing system with other heterogeneous modules, 3) communication ability among all heterogeneous modules which have different operating systems, 4) automatic connection management system when a new module is attached, 5) automatic software upgrading system for new module software. We explain the three parts of the system architecture which meet the five concepts; mechanical architecture, software architecture, and connection architecture. To verify our architecture, we developed and evaluated a reconfigurable heterogeneous modular service robot by applying the proposed design. 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Two-photon imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) enables long-term observation of neuronal activity in~vivo. However, there are very few studies of GECIs in primates. Here, we report a method for long-term imaging of a GECI, GCaMP6f, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors in cortical neurons of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate. We used a tetracycline-inducible expression system to robustly amplify neuronal GCaMP6f expression and up- and downregulate it for more than 100~days. We succeeded in monitoring spontaneous activity not only from hundreds of neurons three-dimensionally distributed in layers 2 and 3 but also from single dendrites and axons in~layer 1. Furthermore, we detected selective activities from somata, dendrites, and axons in the somatosensory cortex responding to specific tactile stimuli. Our results provide a way to investigate the organization and plasticity of cortical microcircuits at subcellular resolution in non-human primates.},

  abstract = {In the wake of several recent school shootings claims have been made that teens, particularly males, learn violence from the media. This paper investigates depictions of criminals and victims in film, specifically in reference to the gendered nature of violent crime, utilizing a content analysis of popular domestic movies in 1996. We develop a gender measure that is separate and distinct from sex in order to test the relationship between both variables and movie offending and victimization. In our sample, masculinity was significantly related to both movie offending and victimization, but sex was not. This pattern of results indicate that the media may be influential in establishing values that accept violence as one means to accomplish masculinity.},

  abstract = {In recent years two main platforms emerged as powerful key players in the domain of parallel computing: GPUs and FPGAs. Many researches investigate interaction and benefits of coupling them with a general purpose processor (CPU), but very few, and only very recently, integrate the two in the same computational system. Even less research are focusing on direct interaction of the two platforms [1]. This paper presents an open source framework enabling easy integration of GPU and FPGA resources; Our work provides direct data transfer between the two platforms with minimal CPU coordination at high data rate and low latency. Finally, at the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposition of an open source implementation of a system including an FPGA and a GPU that provides code for both sides. Notwithstanding the generality of the presented framework, we present in this paper an actual implementation consisting of a single GPU board and a FPGA board connected through a PCIe link. Measures on this implementation demonstrate achieved data rate that are close to the theoretical maximum.},

  abstract = {Recently, non-linear statistical measures such as multi-scale entropy (MSE) have been introduced as indices of the complexity of electrophysiology and fMRI time-series across multiple time scales. In this work, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of complexity (MSE) of electrophysiology and fMRI signals and their relations to functional connectivity (FC). MSE and FC analyses were performed on simulated data using neural mass model based brain network model with the Brain Dynamics Toolbox, on animal models with concurrent recording of fMRI and electrophysiology in conjunction with pharmacological manipulations, and on resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results show that the complexity of regional electrophysiology and fMRI signals is positively correlated with network FC. The associations between MSE and FC are dependent on the temporal scales or frequencies, with higher associations between MSE and FC at lower temporal frequencies. Our results from theoretical modeling, animal experiment and human fMRI indicate that 1) Regional neural complexity and network FC may be two related aspects of brain's information processing: the more complex regional neural activity, the higher FC this region has with other brain regions; 2) MSE at high and low frequencies may represent local and distributed information processing across brain regions. Based on literature and our data, we propose that the complexity of regional neural signals may serve as an index of the brain's capacity of information processing \textendash{} increased complexity may indicate greater transition or exploration between different states of brain networks, thereby a greater propensity for information processing.},

A standard histopathology slice can be easily scanned at a high resolution of, say, 200,000\texttimes{}200,000 pixels. These high resolution images can make most existing imaging processing tools infeasible or less effective when operated on a single machine with limited memory, disk space and computing power. In this paper, we propose an algorithm tackling this new emerging ``big data'' problem utilizing parallel computing on High-Performance-Computing (HPC) clusters. Experimental results on a large-scale data set (1318 images at a scale of 10 billion pixels each) demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for low-latency real-time applications. The framework proposed an effective and efficient system for extremely large histopathology image analysis. It is based on the multiple instance learning formulation for weakly-supervised learning for image classification, segmentation and clustering. When a max-margin concept is adopted for different clusters, we obtain further improvement in clustering performance.},

  abstract = {Background: The extended, 32-item version of the Sniffin' Sticks identification test was developed in order to create a precise tool enabling repeated, longitudinal testing of individual olfactory subfunctions. New method: Odors of the previous test version had to be changed for technical reasons, and the odor identification test needed re-investigation in terms of reliability, validity, and normative values. Results: In our study we investigated olfactory abilities of a group of 100 patients with olfactory dysfunction and 100 controls. We reconfirmed the high test-retest reliability of the extended version of the Sniffin' Sticks identification test and high correlations between the new and the original part of this tool. In addition, we confirmed the validity of the test as it discriminated clearly between controls and patients with olfactory loss. Comparison with existing method(s): The additional set of 16 odor identification sticks can be either included in the current olfactory test, thus creating a more detailed diagnosis tool, or it can be used separately, enabling to follow olfactory function over time. Additionally, the normative values presented in our paper might provide useful guidelines for interpretation of the extended identification test results. Conclusions: The revised version of the Sniffin' Sticks 32-item odor identification test is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of olfactory function.},

  abstract = {Mice were exposed to ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic pulses averaging 99-105 kV/m peak amplitude, 0.97-1.03 ns duration, and 155-174 ps rise time, after intraperitoneal administration of saline or morphine sulfate. They were then tested for thermal nociception on a 50$^\circ$C surface and for spontaneous locomotor activity and its time profile over 5 min. Analysis of results showed no effect of UWB exposure on nociception and activity measures in CF-1 mice after 15-, 30-, or 45-min exposure to pulses at 600/s or after 30-min exposure to UWB pulses at 60/s. Similarly, no effect was seen in C57BL/6 mice after 30-min exposure to pulses at 60/s or 600/s. Although trends in morphine-modified measures seen with UWB pulse repetition frequency could be expected because of increased levels of low-frequency energy, no significant change was seen in normal or morphine-modified nociception or activity after UWB exposure. This indicated lack of effect of the UWB pulses used in these experiments on nervous system components, including endogenous opioids, involved in these behaviors.

  abstract = {Microbial-type rhodopsins are found in archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Some of them represent membrane ion transport proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, or channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1), a recently identified light-gated proton channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ChR1 and ChR2, a related microbial-type rhodopsin from C. reinhardtii, were shown to be involved in generation of photocurrents of this green alga. We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that ChR2 is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. ChR2 desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the ChR2 ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. ChR2 is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane $\alpha$ helices of ChR2 are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that ChR2 may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resis-tive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC at-tempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight up-date in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replica-tion. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work. The experiment results show that, PipeLayer achieves the speedup of 42.45x compared with GPU platform on average. The average energy saving of PipeLayer com-pared with GPU implementation is 7.17x.},

Pathophysiological and imaging studies along with attempts at lesioning the basal ganglia, have offered clues as to nodes in the circuitry that may be amenable to neuromodulation. DBS in neuropsychiatric illness has offered hope, but at this time rigorous screening by interdisciplinary and ethical teams should be employed when establishing treatment candidacy. A cautious approach to these disorders utilizing institutional review board approved research protocols will hopefully shed light onto patient selection and brain target(s) for each disorder. We need to keep an open mind as we move forward and especially that rational therapy may need to be patient and symptom specific.

  doi = {10.4230/LIPIcs.CCC.2017.17},
  abstract = {\textcopyright{} Alexey Milovanov and Nikolay Vereshchagin. A fundamental notion in Algorithmic Statistics is that of a stochastic object, i.e., an object having a simple plausible explanation. Informally, a probability distribution is a plausible explanation for x if it looks likely that x was drawn at random with respect to that distribution. In this paper, we suggest three definitions of a plausible statistical hypothesis for Algorithmic Statistics with polynomial time bounds, which are called acceptability, plausibility and optimality. Roughly speaking, a probability distribution $\mu$ is called an acceptable explanation for x, if x possesses all properties decidable by short programs in a short time and shared by almost all objects (with respect to $\mu$). Plausibility is a similar notion, however this time we require x to possess all properties T decidable even by long programs in a short time and shared by almost all objects. To compensate the increase in program length, we strengthen the notion of 'almost all' - the longer the program recognizing the property is, the more objects must share the property. Finally, a probability distribution $\mu$ is called an optimal explanation for x if $\mu$(x) is large (close to 2-Cpoly(x)). Almost all our results hold under some plausible complexity theoretic assumptions. Our main result states that for acceptability and plausibility there are infinitely many non-stochastic objects, i.e. objects that do not have simple plausible (acceptable) explanations. Using the same techniques, we show that the distinguishing complexity of a string x can be super-logarithmically less than the conditional complexity of x with condition r for almost all r (for polynomial time bounded programs). Finally, we study relationships between the introduced notions.},

  abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10\%.},

  abstract = {We investigated the use of flavoprotein autofluorescence (FA) as a tool to map long-range neural connections and combined FA with laser-uncaging of glutamate to facilitate rapid long-range mapping in vitro. Using the somatosensory thalamocortical slice, we determined that the spatial resolution of FA is $\geq$100\textendash{}200 $\mu$m and that the sensitivity for detecting thalamocortical synaptic activity approximates that of whole cell recording. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX and AP5 abolished cortical responses to electrical thalamic stimulation. The combination of FA with photostimulation using caged glutamate revealed robust long-distance connectivity patterns that could be readily assessed in slices from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual systems that contained thalamocortical, corticothalamic, or corticocortical connections. We mapped the projection from theventral posterior nucleus of thalamus (VPM) to the primary somatosensory cortex-barrel field and confirmed topography that had been previously described using more laborious methods. We also produced a novel map of the projections from the VPM to the thalamic reticular nucleus, showing precise topography along the dorsoventral axis. Importantly, only about 30 s were needed to generate the connectivity map (six stimulus locations). These data suggest that FA is a sensitive tool for exploring and measuring connectivity and, when coupled with glutamate photostimulation, can rapidly map long-range projections in a single animal.},

However, the complexity of the necessary electronic driving circuit can hinder their application. A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. \{ForceAtlas\}2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

  abstract = {Although engraftment of undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into the injured central nervous system (CNS) may lead to targeted cell replacement of lost/damaged cells, sustained proliferative activity combined with uncontrolled differentiation of implanted cells presents a risk of tumor formation. As tumorigenic potential is thought to be associated with pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, pre-differentiation may circumvent this problem. Recently, it has been demonstrated that tumorigenesis occurs despite pre-differentiation if the neural precursor cells are implanted into the brain of a homologous animal (e.g., mouse to mouse). However, xenotransplantation (e.g., mouse to rat) without pre-differentiation, lead to the development of healthy neuronal cells, in absence of tumor formation, suggesting that tumor-suppressive effects of host tissue on engrafted ESCs may play a role in transplant tumorigenesis. We critically investigated tumorigenesis and possible mechanisms of anticipated tumor-suppressive effect under conditions analogous to previously published studies. Xenotransplantation of D-3 murine ESCs into uninjured adult rat brains lacking any preliminary inflammatory potential was found to lead to tumor formation in 5 out of 8 of animals within 2 weeks postimplantation. Tumor-suppressive effects, reflected by Erdo et. al could possibly be ascribed to immunomodulatory activity of macrophages scavenging the tumorigenic fraction of the implanted cells. The importance of number of engrafted cells, implantation site and immunosuppressive effects are discussed as possible variables determining tumorigenic outcome after ESC transplantation.

This paper reviews how well people are able to make such judgments, the evidence for individual signs of intoxication, several structured rating techniques, and the use of sobriety tests. It is concluded that observers relying on common-sense clues of intoxication have limited ability to assess the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of strangers, particularly below .10\%. This generalization holds across professions that might be expected to show greater accuracy. Structured assessment instruments based on observable signs have shown promise but are confounded by the wide variations between casual social drinkers and those that have obtained a high level of tolerance. Among sobriety tests, only NHTSA's Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) have substantial, but seriously flawed, research support. Assessing the sobriety of strangers in the low to moderate BAC ranges without resort to chemical tests remains a daunting task. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Conventional microscopy collects data from individual planes and cannot sample circuitry across large volumes at the temporal resolution relevant to neural circuit function and behaviors. Here we review emerging technologies for rapid volume imaging of neural circuitry. We focus on two critical challenges: the inertia of optical systems, which limits image speed, and aberrations, which restrict the image volume. Optical sampling time must be long enough to ensure high-fidelity measurements, but optimized sampling strategies and point-spread function engineering can facilitate rapid volume imaging of neural activity within this constraint. We also discuss new computational strategies for processing and analyzing volume imaging data of increasing size and complexity. Together, optical and computational advances are providing a broader view of neural circuit dynamics and helping elucidate how brain regions work in concert to support behavior.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 SPIE. Networks of neurons are inherently three-dimensional in nature, whereas conventional imaging methods, such as laser scanning two-photon microscopy, usually provide only fast two-dimensional imaging. Rapid volumetric imaging would however be preferable for imaging neurons. To get a more complete picture of the dynamics of the neuron-to-neuron interactions, we have developed a pseudo-parallelised multi-plane two-photon excitation imaging system through the incorporation of an acousto-optic switching and a remote focusing technique into a resonant scanning microscope. This permits the recording of millisecond scale fluorescence transients of calcium indicators from large populations of neurons upon neural firing events at multiple chosen axial planes in very short time frame. While the remote focusing system offers aberration-free axial scanning over a few hundreds of micrometres of depth, the acousto-optic deflector provides high speed optical switching between different laser beam paths in sub-microsecond timescale which in turn, controls the axial focal plane to be targeted. Here, we report on the development of the high temporal resolution multi-plane targeted microscope and its potential application.},

  abstract = {The energy of ionic thermal motion presents universally, which is as high as 4 kJ\textperiodcentered{}kg -1 \textperiodcentered{}K -1 in aqueous solution, where thermal velocity of ions is in the order of hundreds of meters per second at room temperature 1,2 . Moreover, the thermal velocity of ions can be maintained by the external environment, which means it is limitless. However, little study has been reported on converting the ionic thermal energy into electricity. Here we present a graphene device with asymmetric electrodes configurationto capture such ionic thermal energy and convert it into electricity. An output voltage around 0.35 V was generated when the device was dipped into saturated CuCl2 solution, in which this value lasted over twenty days. A positive correlation between the open-circuit voltage and the temperature, as well as the cation concentration, was observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this finding is of practical value by lighting a commercial light-emitting diode up with six of such graphene devices connected in series. A typical device showed that the power density can be as high as 70 KW/Kg. This finding provides a new way to understand the behavior of graphene at molecular scale and represents a huge breakthrough for the research of self-powered technology. Moreover, the finding will benefit quite a few applications, such as artificial organs, clean renewable energy and portable electronics, which are longing for novel battery technology},

  abstract = {Recent deep learning (DL) models have moved beyond static network architectures to dynamic ones, handling data where the network structure changes every example, such as sequences of variable lengths, trees, and graphs. Existing dataflow-based programming models for DL---both static and dynamic declaration---either cannot readily express these dynamic models, or are inefficient due to repeated dataflow graph construction and processing, and difficulties in batched execution. We present Cavs, a vertex-centric programming interface and optimized system implementation for dynamic DL models. Cavs represents dynamic network structure as a static vertex function \$$\backslash$mathcal\{F\}\$ and a dynamic instance-specific graph \$$\backslash$mathcal\{G\}\$, and performs backpropagation by scheduling the execution of \$$\backslash$mathcal\{F\}\$ following the dependencies in \$$\backslash$mathcal\{G\}\$. Cavs bypasses expensive graph construction and preprocessing overhead, allows for the use of static graph optimization techniques on pre-defined operations in \$$\backslash$mathcal\{F\}\$, and naturally exposes batched execution opportunities over different graphs. Experiments comparing Cavs to two state-of-the-art frameworks for dynamic NNs (TensorFlow Fold and DyNet) demonstrate the efficacy of this approach: Cavs achieves a near one order of magnitude speedup on training of various dynamic NN architectures, and ablations demonstrate the contribution of our proposed batching and memory management strategies.},

  abstract = {Memory corruption, reading uninitialized memory, using freed memory, and other memory-related errors are among the most difficult programming bugs to identify and fix due to the delay and non-determinism linking the error to an observable symptom. Dedicated memory checking tools are invaluable for finding these errors. However, such tools are difficult to build, and because they must monitor all memory accesses by the application, they incur significant overhead. Accuracy is another challenge: memory errors are not always straightforward to identify, and numerous false positive error reports can make a tool unusable. A third obstacle to creating such a tool is that it depends on low-level operating system and architectural details, making it difficult to port to other platforms and difficult to target proprietary systems like Windows. This paper presents Dr. Memory, a memory checking tool that operates on both Windows and Linux applications. Dr. Memory handles the complex and not fully documented Windows environment, and avoids reporting false positive memory leaks that plague traditional leak locating algorithms. Dr. Memory employs efficient instrumentation techniques; a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art Valgrind Memcheck tool reveals that Dr. Memory is twice as fast as Memcheck on average and up to four times faster on individual benchmarks.},

  title = {Making Computer Vision Computationally Efficient},
  abstract = {Computational requirements for computer vision algorithms have been increasing dramatically at a rate of several orders of magnitude per decade. In fact, the growth in the size of datasets and computational demands for computer vision algorithms are outpacing Moore's law scaling. Meanwhile, parallelism has become the major driver of improvements in hardware performance. Even in such a scenario, there has been a lack of interest in parallelizing computer vision applications from vision domain experts whose main concern has been productivity. We believe that ignoring parallelism is no longer an option. Numerical optimization and parallelization are essential for current and future generation of vision applications to run on efficiently on parallel hardware. In this thesis, we describe the computational characteristics of computer vision workloads using patterns. We show examples of how careful numerical optimization has led to increased speedups on many computer vision and machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, optical flow, point tracking, image contour detection and video segmentation. Together, these application kernels appear in about 50\% of computer vision applications, making them excellent targets for focusing our attention. We focus our efforts on GPUs, as they are the most parallel commodity hardware available today. GPUs also have high memory bandwidth which is useful as most computer vision algorithms are bandwidth bound. In conjunction with the advantages of GPUs for parallel processing, our optimizations (both numeric and low-level) have made the above mentioned algorithms practical to run on large data sets. We will also describe how these optimizations have enabled new, more accurate algorithms that previously would have been considered impractical. In addition to implementing computer vision algorithms on parallel platforms (GPUs and multicore CPUs), we propose tools to optimize the movement of data between the CPU and GPU. We have achieved speedups of 4-76x for support vector machine training, 4-372x for SVM classification, 37x for large displacement optical flow and 130x for image contour detection compared to serial implementations. A significant portion of the speedups in each case was obtained from algorithmic changes and numerical optimization. Better algorithms have improved performance not only on manycore platforms like GPUs, but also on multicore CPUs. In addition to achieving speedups on existing applications, our tool for helping manage data movement between CPU and GPU has reduced runtime by a factor of 1.7-7.8x and the amount of data transferred by over 100x. Taken together, these tools and techniques serve as important guidelines for analyzing and parallelizing computer vision algorithms.},

  abstract = {We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

The GPU-based X-engine of this correlator processes over 819 Gb/s of 4+4-bit complex astronomical data from N=256 inputs across a 400 MHz radio band. A software framework is presented to manage this real-time data flow, which allows each of 16 processing servers to handle 51.2 Gb/s of astronomical data, plus 8 Gb/s of ancillary data. Each server receives data in the form of UDP packets from an FPGA F-engine over the eight 10 GbE links, combines data from these packets into large (32MB-256MB) buffered frames, and transfers them to multiple GPU co-processors for correlation. The results from the GPUs are combined and normalized, then transmitted to a collection server, where they are merged into a single file. Aggressive optimizations enable each server to handle this high rate of data; allowing the efficient correlation of 25 MHz of radio bandwidth per server. The solution scales well to larger values of N by adding additional servers.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on drivers of franchise network internationalization, namely, intangible resources and plural form. Intangible resources refer to those that the franchisor acquires over time and are deemed instrumental to firm success, namely, brand name, monitoring, and know-how transfer abilities. Plural form refers to the coexistence of franchised outlets and company-owned outlets within the same network. The empirical study involves 853 U.S. and French networks. Findings indicate that the percentage of company-owned outlets in international networks is lower than that in purely domestic networks, and this holds for both the combined data sample (United States and France) and the U.S. sample on its own. Moreover, U.S. franchisors are shown to be much more internationalized, with a smaller percentage of company-owned outlets than their French counterparts. The intangible resource that most strongly affects franchise internationalization is brand-name recognition, whereas there is partial support for the impact of two other intangible resources, namely, monitoring and know-how transfer ability. The results of the logistic regression models underscore the importance of intangible resources in franchise network internationalization as well as the significant and negative impact of percentage of company-owned outlets. Finally, the drivers of internationalization are not found to be statistically different between both countries. \textcopyright{} 2013 International Council for Small Business.},

  abstract = {Using existing programming tools, writing high-performance im- age processing code requires sacrificing readability, portability, and modularity. We argue that this is a consequence of conflating what computations define the algorithm, with decisions about storage and the order of computation. We refer to these latter two concerns as the schedule, including choices of tiling, fusion, recomputation vs. storage, vectorization, and parallelism. We propose a representation for feed-forward imaging pipelines that separates the algorithm from its schedule, enabling high- performance without sacrificing code clarity. This decoupling sim- plifies the algorithm specification: images and intermediate buffers become functions over an infinite integer domain, with no explicit storage or boundary conditions. Imaging pipelines are compo- sitions of functions. Programmers separately specify scheduling strategies for the various functions composing the algorithm, which allows them to efficiently explore different optimizations without changing the algorithmic code. We demonstrate the power of this representation by expressing a range of recent image processing applications in an embedded domain specific language called Halide, and compiling them for ARM, x86, and GPUs. Our compiler targets SIMD units, multiple cores, and complex memory hierarchies. We demonstrate that it can handle algorithms such as a camera raw pipeline, the bilateral grid, fast local Laplacian filtering, and image segmentation. The al- gorithms expressed in our language are both shorter and faster than state-of-the-art implementations.},

  abstract = {Studying brain function and its local circuit dynamics requires neural interfaces that can record and stimulate the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetics, a technique that genetically targets specific neurons to express light-sensitive channel proteins, provides the capability to control central nervous system neuronal activity in mammals with millisecond time precision. This technique enables precise optical stimulation of neurons and simultaneous monitoring of neural response by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We previously demonstrated, in vitro, the dual capability (optical delivery and electrical recording) while testing a novel hybrid device (optrode-MEA), which incorporates a tapered coaxial optical electrode (optrode) and a 100 element microelectrode array (MEA). Here we report a fully chronic implant of a new version of this device in ChR2-expressing rats, and demonstrate its use in freely moving animals over periods up to 8 months. In its present configuration, we show the device delivering optical excitation to a single cortical site while mapping the neural response from the surrounding 30 channels of the 6 \texttimes{} 6 element MEA, thereby enabling recording of optically modulated single-unit and local field potential activity across several millimeters of the neocortical landscape.},

Simultaneous optical imaging in two bands is enabled by a dichroic beam splitter centered at 567 nm, with Sloan u' and g' bands available on the blue arm and Sloan r', i' and z\_s' bands available on the red arm. Additional narrow-band filters will also become available as required. An Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) detector is employed for both optical channels, each capable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under multiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000 fps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. CHIMERA was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).},

It uses algorithmic information theory to define formally what is a good explanation. In this paper we extend this framework in two directions. First, the explanations are not only interesting in themselves but also used for prediction: we want to know what kind of data we may reasonably expect in similar situations (repeating the same experiment). We show that some kind of hierarchy can be constructed both in terms of algorithmic statistics and using the notion of a priori probability, and these two approaches turn out to be equivalent. Second, a more realistic approach that goes back to machine learning theory, assumes that we have not a single data string \$x\$ but some set of "positive examples" \$x\_1,$\backslash$ldots,x\_l\$ that all belong to some unknown set \$A\$, a property that we want to learn. We want this set \$A\$ to contain all positive examples and to be as small and simple as possible. We show how algorithmic statistic can be extended to cover this situation.},

  abstract = {A classical problem in computational geometry is the planar point location problem. This problem calls for preprocessing a polygonal subdivision of the plane defined by n line segments so that, given a sequence of points, the polygon containing each point can be determined quickly on-line. Several ways of solving this problem in O(log n) query time and O(n) space are known, but they are all rather complicated. We propose a simple O(log n)-query-time, O(n)-space solution, using persistent search trees. A persistent search tree differs from an ordinary search tree in that after an insertion or deletion, the old version of the tree can still be accessed. We develop a persistent form of binary search tree that supports insertions and deletions in the present and queries in the past. The time per query or update is O(log m), where m is the total number of updates, and the space needed is O(1) per update. Our planar point location algorithm is an immediate application of this data structure. The structure also provides an alternative to Chazelle's "hive graph" structure, which has a variety of applications in geometric retrieval.},

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity but implementations require suitable (normal) compression algorithms. We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image. The proposed algorithm is compared with several other methods.},

@article{such_deep_2017,
  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of techniques that have been developed in the neuroevolution community to improve performance on RL problems. To demonstrate the latter, we show that combining DNNs with novelty search, which was designed to encourage exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA parallelizes better than ES, A3C, and DQN, and enables a state-of-the-art compact encoding technique that can represent million-parameter DNNs in thousands of bytes.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain\textendash{}computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or \~15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

  abstract = {Transgenic mouse lines are invaluable tools for neuroscience but as with any technique, care must be taken to ensure that the tool itself does not unduly affect the system under study. Here we report aberrant electrical activity, similar to interictal spikes, and accompanying fluorescence events in some genotypes of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6 genetically-encoded calcium sensors. These epileptiform events have been observed particularly, but not exclusively, in mice with Emx1-Cre and Ai93 transgenes, of either sex, across multiple laboratories. The events occur at \&gt;0.1 Hz, are very large in amplitude (\&gt;1.0 mV local field potentials, \&gt;10\% df/f widefield imaging signals), and typically cover large regions of cortex. Many properties of neuronal responses and behavior seem normal despite these events, though rare subjects exhibit overt generalized seizures. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear, but we speculate about possible causes on the basis of diverse observations. We encourage researchers to be aware of these activity patterns while interpreting neuronal recordings from affected mouse lines and when considering which lines to study.Significance Statement Genetically-encoded calcium sensors have revolutionized neuroscience by providing a powerful way to measure neural activity with optical imaging. Transgenic mice that express these indicators have proved a particularly useful technology for their stability, ease of use, and breadth of expression. However, here we report that some of these mouse lines have major abnormalities in their brain activity, including large, broad events resembling epileptic activity. We confirmed these abnormalities across multiple laboratories and we provide methods to detect them. This finding is an important point of caution for researchers using genetically-encoded calcium indicators to study neural activity.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11265-017-1262-6},
  abstract = {Designing applications for scalability is key to improving their performance in hybrid and cluster computing. Scheduling code to utilize parallelism is difficult, particularly when dealing with data dependencies, memory management, data motion, and processor occupancy. The Hybrid Task Graph Scheduler (HTGS) improves programmer productivity when implementing hybrid workflows for multi-core and multi-GPU systems. The Hybrid Task Graph Scheduler (HTGS) is an abstract execution model, framework, and API that increases programmer productivity when implementing hybrid workflows for such systems. HTGS manages dependencies between tasks, represents CPU and GPU memories independently, overlaps computations with disk I/O and memory transfers, keeps multiple GPUs occupied, and uses all available compute resources. Through these abstractions, data motion and memory are explicit; this makes data locality decisions more accessible. To demonstrate the HTGS application program interface (API), we present implementations of two example algorithms: (1) a matrix multiplication that shows how easily task graphs can be used; and (2) a hybrid implementation of microscopy image stitching that reduces code size by $\approx$ 43\% compared to a manually coded hybrid workflow implementation and showcases the minimal overhead of task graphs in HTGS. Both of the HTGS-based implementations show good performance. In image stitching the HTGS implementation achieves similar performance to the hybrid workflow implementation. Matrix multiplication with HTGS achieves 1.3x and 1.8x speedup over the multi-threaded OpenBLAS library for 16k \{$\backslash$texttimes\} 16k and 32k \{$\backslash$texttimes\} 32k size matrices, respectively.},

Their FRET responses were optimized by a large-scale functional screen in bacterial colonies, refined by a secondary screen in rat hippocampal neuron cultures. We tested the in vivo performance of the most sensitive variants in the brain and lymph nodes of mice. The sensitivity of the Twitch sensors matched that of synthetic calcium dyes and allowed visualization of tonic action potential firing in neurons and high resolution functional tracking of T lymphocytes. Given their ratiometric readout, their brightness, large dynamic range and linear response properties, Twitch sensors represent versatile tools for neuroscience and immunology.},

  abstract = {Exposure to psychostimulant drugs leads to sensitized locomotor responding, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) overflow, and drug self-administration upon reexposure to the drug weeks to months later. Calcium-dependent signaling pathways contribute importantly to both the induction and expression of sensitization by these drugs. In particular, calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in forebrain regions such as the NAcc, is known to contribute to the expression of several forms of plasticity including sensitization. Notably, pharmacologically inhibiting CaMKII in the NAcc prevents the expression of sensitized locomotion, NAcc DA overflow, and drug taking. Evidence indicates that CaMKII may act both pre- and postsynaptically in this site to influence the expression of these manifestations of sensitization. Presynaptically in DA neuron terminals, CaMKII regulates sensitized DA overflow. Postsynaptically in medium spiny neurons, it contributes to the upregulation of AMPA receptors, the activation of which is necessary for the expression of sensitization. It is conceivable that interactions between CaMKII-mediated neuroadaptations in both of these sites may underlie the long-lasting maintenance of sensitization by psychostimulant drugs.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics, the ability to use light to activate and silence specific neuron types within neural networks in vivo and in vitro, is revolutionizing neuroscientists' capacity to understand how defined neural circuit elements contribute to normal and pathological brain functions. Typically, awake behaving experiments are conducted by inserting an optical fiber into the brain, tethered to a remote laser, or by utilizing an implanted light-emitting diode (LED), tethered to a remote power source. A fully wireless system would enable chronic or longitudinal experiments where long duration tethering is impractical, and would also support high-throughput experimentation. However, the high power requirements of light sources (LEDs, lasers), especially in the context of the extended illumination periods often desired in experiments, precludes battery-powered approaches from being widely applicable. We have developed a headborne device weighing 2 g capable of wirelessly receiving power using a resonant RF power link and storing the energy in an adaptive supercapacitor circuit, which can algorithmically control one or more headborne LEDs via a microcontroller. The device can deliver approximately 2 W of power to the LEDs in steady state, and 4.3 W in bursts. We also present an optional radio transceiver module (1 g) which, when added to the base headborne device, enables real-time updating of light delivery protocols; dozens of devices can be controlled simultaneously from one computer. We demonstrate use of the technology to wirelessly drive cortical control of movement in mice. These devices may serve as prototypes for clinical ultra-precise neural prosthetics that use light as the modality of biological control.},

  abstract = {The volume, diversity and velocity of biomedical data are exponentially increasing providing petabytes of new neuroimaging and genetics data every year. At the same time, tens-of-thousands of computational algorithms are developed and reported in the literature along with thousands of software tools and services. Users demand intuitive, quick and platform-agnostic access to data, software tools, and infrastructure from millions of hardware devices. This explosion of information, scientific techniques, computational models, and technological advances leads to enormous challenges in data analysis, evidence-based biomedical inference and reproducibility of findings. The Pipeline workflow environment provides a crowd-based distributed solution for consistent management of these heterogeneous resources. The Pipeline allows multiple (local) clients and (remote) servers to connect, exchange protocols, control the execution, monitor the states of different tools or hardware, and share complete protocols as portable XML workflows. In this paper, we demonstrate several advanced computational neuroimaging and genetics case-studies, and end-to-end pipeline solutions. These are implemented as graphical workflow protocols in the context of analyzing imaging (sMRI, fMRI, DTI), phenotypic (demographic, clinical), and genetic (SNP) data.},

  abstract = {Brain hemodynamics serve as a proxy for neural activity in a range of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging \{(fMRI).\} In resting-state \{fMRI,\} hemodynamic fluctuations have been found to exhibit patterns of bilateral synchrony, with correlated regions inferred to have functional connectivity. However, the relationship between resting-state hemodynamics and underlying neural activity has not been well established, making the neural underpinnings of functional connectivity networks unclear. In this study, neural activity and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously over the bilateral cortex of awake and anesthetized \{Thy1-GCaMP\} mice using wide-field optical mapping. Neural activity was visualized via selective expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorophore \{GCaMP\} in layer 2/3 and 5 excitatory neurons. Characteristic patterns of resting-state hemodynamics were accompanied by more rapidly changing bilateral patterns of resting-state neural activity. Spatiotemporal hemodynamics could be modeled by convolving this neural activity with hemodynamic response functions derived through both deconvolution and gamma-variate fitting. Simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology confirmed that \{Thy1-GCaMP\} signals are well-predicted by multiunit activity. Neurovascular coupling between resting-state neural activity and hemodynamics was robust and fast in awake animals, whereas coupling in urethane-anesthetized animals was slower, and in some cases included lower-frequency (\{\}0.04 Hz) hemodynamic fluctuations that were not well-predicted by local \{Thy1-GCaMP\} recordings. These results support that resting-state hemodynamics in the awake and anesthetized brain are coupled to underlying patterns of excitatory neural activity. The patterns of bilaterally-symmetric spontaneous neural activity revealed by wide-field \{Thy1-GCaMP\} imaging may depict the neural foundation of functional connectivity networks detected in resting-state \{fMRI.\}},

The intent is to explore using these biomarkers to drive prosthetic actuators or titrate therapy devices such as a deep-brain neurostimulator. The prototype IC uses 5 muW/channel to resolve signals on the order of 1 muVrms. The four channels on the device provide independent spectral analysis from DC to 1 kHz, with variable bandwidth and power filtering characteristics. The noise floor and flexible spectral processing support a broad range of potential applications including sleep staging, Parkinson's disease, detection of movement intention for neuroprosthesis, and detection of high frequency ldquofast ripplesrdquo for exploring seizure prediction. To fully demonstrate the IC's functionality, we include results from a prototype ldquoclosed-looprdquo neurostimulator implementing adaptive titration of therapy based on measured field potential activity.},

  abstract = {Flavoprotein fluorescence in the brain is intimately coupled with neuronal aerobic energy metabolism. If flavoproteins are photobleached, neural activities may be affected owing to dysfunction in aerobic energy metabolism in mitochondria. We tested this possibility in cortical slices from mice, and found that exposure to blue light ([lambda] = 475 nm) derived from a 20 mW diode laser for 50 min suppresses trans-synaptic components of field potentials. This finding formed the basis of a transcranial photo-inactivation technique, that was used to investigate auditory signal transmission between the anterior auditory field (AAF) and the primary auditory cortex (AI) in anesthetized mice. Cortical responses in AAF and AI, elicited by 5 kHz tonal stimuli, were visualized using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. After determining responsive areas in AAF and AI, the auditory cortex was exposed to the blue diode laser via the intact skull, while either AAF or AI was protected with a piece of carbon paper. Although the photo-inactivation of AI had no significant effect on the fluorescence responses in AAF, the photo-inactivation of AAF significantly reduced the fluorescence responses in AI, indicating the presence of auditory signal transmission from AAF to AI.},

Several studies have suggested that optical stimulation provides the precision and dynamic range requisite for closed-loop neuronal control, but no approach yet permits feedback control of neuronal firing. Here we present the `optoclamp', a feedback control technology that provides continuous, real-time adjustments of bidirectional optical stimulation in order to lock spiking activity at specified targets over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant manner.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} Zhuo et al.Adult neurogenesis supports performance in many hippocampal dependent tasks. Considering the small number of adult-born neurons generated at any given time, it is surprising that this sparse population of cells can substantially influence behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that heightened excitability and plasticity may be critical for the contribution of young adult-born cells for certain tasks. What is not well understood is how these unique biophysical and synaptic properties may translate to networks that support behavioral function. Here we employed a location discrimination task in mice while using optogenetics to transiently silence adult-born neurons at different ages. We discovered that adult-born neurons promote location discrimination during early stages of development but only if they undergo maturation during task acquisition. Silencing of young adult-born neurons also produced changes extending to the contralateral hippocampus, detectable by both electrophysiology and fMRI measurements, suggesting young neurons may modulate location discrimination through influences on bilateral hippocampal networks.},

  abstract = {Light and heat distributions are measured in a rat glioma model used in photodynamic therapy. A fiber delivering 632-nm light is fixed in the brain of anesthetized BDIX rats. Fluence rates are measured using calibrated isotropic probes that are positioned stereotactically. Mathematical models are then used to derive tissue optical properties, enabling calculation of fluence rate distributions for general tumor and light application geometries. The fluence rates in tumor-free brains agree well with the models based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In both cases, the best fit is found for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of 0.57 and 28cm-1, respectively. In brains with implanted BT4C tumors, a discrepancy between diffusion and Monte Carlo\textendash{}derived two-layer models is noted. Both models suggest that tumor tissue has higher absorption and less scattering than normal brain. Temperatures are measured by inserting thermocouples directly into tumor-free brains. A model based on diffusion theory and the bioheat equation is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and predict a thermal penetration depth of 0.60cm in normal rat brain. The predicted parameters can be used to estimate the fluences, fluence rates, and temperatures achieved during photodynamic therapy.},

Genetic manipulations have created a vast array of bright and stable FPs spanning blue to red spectral regions. Common to autofluorescent FPs is their tight b-barrel structure, which provides the rigidity and chemical environment needed for effectual fluorescence. Despite the common structure, each FP has unique properties. Thus, there is no single `best' FP for every circumstance, and each FP has advantages and disadvantages. To guide decisions about which FP is right for a given application, we have quantitatively characterized the brightness, photostability, pH stability and monomeric properties of more than 40 FPs to enable straightforward and direct comparison between them. We focus on popular and/or top-performing FPs in each spectral region.},

  abstract = {Background: Mouse pups are invaluable model animals for understanding the molecular and neural basis underlying behavioral development. Stereotaxic operations with anesthetic control are useful tools in systems neuroscience. However, there are no commercially available anesthetic or stereotaxic devices for mouse pups. Current devices have several problems such as invasive approach for stabilization, poor sanitary control, and less flexibility to combine other surgical apparatuses. New Method: Here, we developed an inhalation anesthetic device equipped with stereotaxic function for mouse pups, by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). PDMS is tolerant to heat and water exposure, and soft enough to cut or make a hole. The anesthetic and the stereotaxic parts were fabricated from the three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) data obtained from the head of a real mouse pup. Results: To confirm its utility, a tracer was injected into the brain. We were able to anesthetize and stabilize pups at once in a non-invasive manner using the PDMS device. The histological staining revealed that tracer injection was successful. Our device was compatible with various types of commercial stereotaxic and anesthetic apparatuses via trimming and tube insertion, respectively. Comparison with existing method(s): To our knowledge, this is the first report of a device that can stabilize the mouse pup's head with the non-invasive manner and functions as an inhalation anesthetic device that can be sterilized. Conclusions: The present fabrication method will provide a handy and functional instrument for stereotaxic operations in animal models at various developmental stages.},

  abstract = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker\textemdash{}the neuron's encoding time scale\textemdash{}allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

  abstract = {Objective:\textasciitilde{}  A prevalence of at least 30\% for treatment-resistant depression has prompted the investigation of alternative treatment strategies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising targeted approach involving the bilateral placement of electrodes at specific neuroanatomical sites. Given the invasive and experimental nature of DBS for treatment-resistant depression, it is important to obtain both short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety data. This report represents an extended follow-up of 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression who received DBS to the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 25).Method:\textasciitilde{}  After an initial 12-month study of DBS, patients were seen annually and at a last follow-up visit to assess depression severity, functional outcomes, and adverse events.Results:\textasciitilde{}  The average response rates 1, 2, and 3 years after DBS implantation were 62.5\%, 46.2\%, and 75\%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit (range=3\textemdash{}6 years), the average response rate was 64.3\%. Functional impairment in the areas of physical health and social functioning progressively improved up to the last follow-up visit. No significant adverse events were reported during this follow-up, although two patients died by suicide during depressive relapses.Conclusions:\textasciitilde{}  These data suggest that in the long term, DBS remains a safe and effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Additional trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.Abstract Teaser},

Its probabilistic basis and capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for studying information flow in the nervous system. It has a number of useful properties: it is a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only linear effects; it has meaningful units which in many cases allow direct comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much information can be gained by observing neural responses in single trials, rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - (see entry "Summary of Information-Theoretic Quantities"). Estimating these quantities in an accurate and unbiased way from real neurophysiological data frequently presents challenges, which are explained in this entry.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor signs affecting gait, postural stability, and tremor. These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency (100\hspace{0.6em}Hz). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) onset or cessation affects PD signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during DBS, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all PD patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on PD and none exploring the effect of DBS was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during DBS, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by DBS-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of DBS effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in PD.},

  abstract = {Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is becoming ever more computationally demanding as temporal and spatial resolutions improve, and large, publicly available data sets proliferate. Moreover, methodological improvements in the neuroimaging pipeline, such as non-linear spatial normalization, non-parametric permutation tests and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, can dramatically increase the computational burden. Despite these challenges, there do not yet exist any fMRI software packages which leverage inexpensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform these analyses. Here, we therefore present BROCCOLI, a free software package written in OpenCL (Open Computing Language) that can be used for parallel analysis of fMRI data on a large variety of hardware configurations. BROCCOLI has, for example, been tested with an Intel CPU, an Nvidia GPU and an AMD GPU. These tests show that parallel processing of fMRI data can lead to significantly faster analysis pipelines. This speedup can be achieved on relatively standard hardware, but further, dramatic speed improvements require only a modest investment in GPU hardware. BROCCOLI (running on a GPU) can perform non-linear spatial normalization to a 1 mm3 brain template in 4-6 seconds, and run a second level permutation test with 10,000 permutations in about a minute. These non-parametric tests are generally more robust than their parametric counterparts, and can also enable more sophisticated analyses by estimating complicated null distributions. Additionally, BROCCOLI includes support for Bayesian first-level fMRI analysis using a Gibbs sampler. The new software is freely available under GNU GPL3 and can be downloaded from github (https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI/).},

These thin wires combine excellent soft magnetic properties (with coercivities up to 4 A/m) with attractive magneto-transport properties (Giant Magneto-impedance effect, GMI, Giant Magneto-resistance effect, GMR) and an unusual re-magnetization process in positive magnetostriction compositions exhibiting quite fast domain wall propagation.

Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of PD. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis. We additionally propose that developing new technologies, e.g., human electrometer and closed-loop smart devices, for monitoring dopaminergic neurotransmission during STN DBS will further advance this treatment approach.},

As the community continues to deepen in its understanding of software engineering thanks to the analysis performed on this platform, we believe it is worthwhile to reflect how research papers have addressed the task of mining GitHub repositories over the last years. In this regard, we present a meta-analysis of 93 research papers which addresses three main dimensions of those papers: i) the empirical methods employed, ii) the datasets they used and iii) the limitations reported. Results of our meta-analysis show some concerns regarding the dataset collection process and size, the low level of replicability, poor sampling techniques, lack of longitudinal studies and scarce variety of methodologies.},

In these new applications, users issue long-running queries over a combination of stored data and sensor data. Most existing applications rely on a centralized system for collecting sensor data. These systems lack flexibility because data is extracted in a predefined way; also, they do not scale to a large number of devices because large volumes of raw data are transferred regardless of the queries that are submitted. In our new concept of sensor database system, queries dictate which data is extracted from the sensors. In this paper, we define the concept of sensor databases mixing stored data represented as relations and sensor data represented as time series. Each long-running query formulated over a sensor database defines a persistent view, which is maintained during a given time interval. We also describe the design and implementation of the COUGAR sensor database system.},

The strategy is based on the exploitation of multiple scattering to provide oblique back illumination of the wavefront-sensor focal plane, enabling a simple and direct measurement of the flux-density tilt angles caused by aberrations at this plane. Advantages of the sensor are that it provides a large measurement field of view (FOV) while requiring no guide star, making it particularly adapted to a type of AO called conjugate AO, which provides a large correction FOV in cases when sample-induced aberrations arise from a single dominant plane (e.g., the sample surface). We apply conjugate AO here to widefield (i.e., nonscanning) fluorescence microscopy for the first time and demonstrate dynamic wavefront correction in a closed-loop implementation.},

Our main idea is to realize physics-based manipulations by running a full physics simulation on proxy geometries given by non-rigidly aligned CAD models. Running these simulations allows us to apply new, unseen forces to move or deform selected objects, change physical parameters such as mass or elasticity, or even add entire new objects that interact with the rest of the underlying scene. In Calipso, the user makes edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then transfered to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a photo-realistic rendering process. To align the CAD models, we introduce an efficient CAD-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics. We demonstrate Calipso's physics-based editing on a wide range of examples producing myriad physical behavior while preserving geometric and visual consistency.},

  abstract = {Background: To evaluate the in vivo function of human dopaminergic (DA) neurons, Parkinson's disease (PD) model rats made by the hemi-lateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) are widely used as host animals. In the case of such xeno-transplantation, however, immunosuppression is needed for good survival of the grafted cells. New methods: In order to determine whether human mature neurons can survive in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) rats without immunosuppression, we grafted human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived DA neurons into the striatum of X-SCID rats. We next treated the X-SCID rats with 6-OHDA and grafted mouse fetal DA neurons or human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DA neurons to examine whether these rats can be used as PD model rats. Results: X-SCID rats did not elicit immune responses against human ESC-derived DA neurons and consequently resulted in good survival of the cells without immunosuppression. Furthermore, 6-OHDA-lesioned X-SCID rats exhibited rotational behavior, which was recovered by grafting mouse fetal DA neurons or human iPSC-derived DA neurons. Comparison with existing methods: Immunosuppression by drugs such as Cyclosporine A requires daily injection, which is stressful for rats and moreover may cause renal or hepatic failure. Furthermore, blood levels of the drug may not be stable, which weakens the reliability of the data. Conclusions: Our results provide a more accessible and reliable method to evaluate the in vivo function of human DA neurons, potentially offering a pre-clinical study for the application of pluripotent stem cells.},

Our goal is to use the preamplifier in a fully integrated, multi-channel, bi-directional neuro-electronic interface. Among others, two main requirements must be addressed when designing such kind of integrated recording systems: noise performance and very low frequency disturbance rejection. These two requirements need to be satisfied together with a small silicon area design, to be able to integrate a large number of recording channels (i.e. up to thousands) onto a single die. A prototype preamplifier circuit has been designed and implemented; in this paper we report the experimental results. While satisfying the above requirements, our circuit offers state-of-the-art smallest area occupation (0.13 mm2) and consumes 4.5 [mu]W. Sub-threshold-biased lateral pnp transistors, used to implement very high resistance value integrated resistors, have been characterized to determine the resistance spread. The fabricated prototype, coupled with a commercial Micro-Electrode Array (MEA), has been successfully employed to record the extracellular electrophysiological spontaneous activity, both of muscular cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) and of spinal cord neurons from murines.},

  abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue\textendash{}green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of `optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

Post-surgical histological studies revealed comparable glial activation as in~control mice. In behaving mice expressing a~Ca2+ indicator in cortical pyramidal neurons, we performed Ca2+ imaging across neocortex using an~epi-fluorescence macroscope and estimated that 25,000\textendash{}50,000 individual neurons were accessible per mouse across multiple focal planes. Two-photon~microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies throughout neocortex, allowed time-lapse imaging of individual cells, and yielded estimates of 1 million accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This approach supports a variety of optical techniques and enables studies of cells across 30 neocortical areas in behaving mice.},

It is shown that the FF-OCT image of the deep region of a biological sample is easily blurred or degraded because the sample has a refractive index (RI) much higher than its surrounding medium in general. It is analyzed that the focal plane of the imaging system is segregated from the imaging plane of the coherence-gated system due to the RI mismatch. This image-blurring phenomenon is experimentally confirmed by imaging the chrome pattern of a resolution test target through its glass substrate in water. Moreover, we demonstrate that the blurred image can be appreciably corrected by using the numerical correction process based on the Fresnel\textendash{}Kirchhoff diffraction theory. The proposed correction method is applied to enhance the image of a human hair, which permits the distinct identification of the melanin granules inside the cortex layer of the hair shaft.},

  abstract = {Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila or C. elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called FlyPi. Our design is based on a 3-D printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under 100 Euros and features optional modules for LED-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs \~200 Euros, or substantially less if the user is prepared to shop around. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPis capabilities we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPis utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres and research labs.},

  shorttitle = {Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement},
  abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z  4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

We use results from a computational model of the Parkinsonian basal ganglia to illustrate general issues relevant to eventual clinical or experimental tests of such an algorithm. Specifically, while the relationship between DBS characteristics and performance is highly complex, global search methods appear able to identify novel and effective waveforms with convergence rates that are acceptably fast to merit further investigation in laboratory or clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

This microscope can produce illumination spots of variable size and number, and in patterns shaped to precisely match user-defined elements in a specimen. Using holographic illumination to photolyze caged glutamate in brain slices, we show that shaped excitation on segments of neuronal dendrites and simultaneous, multispot excitation of different dendrites enables precise spatial and rapid temporal control of glutamate receptor activation. By allowing the excitation volume shape to be tailored precisely, the holographic microscope provides an extremely flexible method for activation of various photosensitive proteins and small molecules.},

  abstract = {Objective:~A prevalence of at least 30\% for treatment-resistant depression has prompted the investigation of alternative treatment strategies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising targeted approach involving the bilateral placement of electrodes at specific neuroanatomical sites. Given the invasive and experimental nature of DBS for treatment-resistant depression, it is important to obtain both short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety data. This report represents an extended follow-up of 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression who received DBS to the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 25).Method:~After an initial 12-month study of DBS, patients were seen annually and at a last follow-up visit to assess depression severity, functional outcomes, and adverse events.Results:~The average response rates 1, 2, and 3 years after DBS implantation were 62.5\%, 46.2\%, and 75\%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit (range=3\textemdash{}6 years), the average response rate was 64.3\%. Functional impairment in the areas of physical health and social functioning progressively improved up to the last follow-up visit. No significant adverse events were reported during this follow-up, although two patients died by suicide during depressive relapses.Conclusions:~These data suggest that in the long term, DBS remains a safe and effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Additional trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.Abstract Teaser},

The importance of the human sense of smell has by far been underestimated in the past. Humans and other primates have been regarded as primarily [‘]optical animals' with highly developed powers of vision but a relatively undeveloped sense of smell. In recent years this assumption has undergone major revision. Several studies indicate that humans indeed seem to use olfactory communication and are even able to produce and perceive certain pheromones; recent studies have found that pheromones may play an important role in the behavioural and reproduction biology of humans. In this article we review the present evidence of the effect of human pheromones and discuss the role of olfactory cues in human sexual behaviour./p},

  abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength GECIs, ``RCaMPs,'' engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby, the red sensor RCaMP, and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP, are conducted simultaneously, with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and ChR2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the RCaMP sensors to R-GECO1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-GECO1 displays higher Ca2+ affinity and larger dynamic range than RCaMP, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-GECO1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from GCaMP by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

Inspired by the idea of interconnecting various existing table interfaces such as the , being developed in Barcelona and the tDesk from Bielefeld, this protocol defines common properties of controller objects on the table surface as well as of finger and hand gestures performed by the user. Currently this protocol has been implemented within a fiducial marker-based computer vision engine developed for the reacTable project. This fast and robust computer vision engine is based on the original d-touch concept, which is also included as an alternative to the newer fiducial tracking engine. The computer vision framework has been implemented on various standard platforms and can be extended with additional sensor components. We are currently working on the tracking of finger-tips for gestural control within the table interface. The Tuio protocol has been implemented using OpenSound Control 4 and is therefore usable on any platform supporting this protocol. At the moment we have working implementations for Java, C++, PureData, Max/MSP, SuperCollider and Flash.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIn addition to the cost and complexity of processing multiple signal channels, manual sleep staging is also tedious, time consuming, and error-prone. The aim of this paper is to propose an automatic slow wave sleep (SWS) detection method that uses only one channel of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. New MethodThe proposed approach distinguishes itself from previous automatic sleep staging methods by using three specially designed feature groups. The first feature group characterizes the waveform pattern of the EEG signal. The remaining two feature groups are developed to resolve the difficulties caused by interpersonal EEG signal differences. Results and comparison with existing methodsThe proposed approach was tested with 1,003 subjects, and the SWS detection results show kappa coefficient at 0.66, an accuracy level of 0.973, a sensitivity score of 0.644 and a positive predictive value of 0.709. By excluding sleep apnea patients and persons whose age is older than 55, the SWS detection results improved to kappa coefficient, 0.76; accuracy, 0.963; sensitivity, 0.758; and positive predictive value, 0.812. ConclusionsWith newly developed signal features, this study proposed and tested a single-channel EEG-based SWS detection method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated by applying it to detect the SWS of 1003 subjects. Our test results show that a low SWS ratio and sleep apnea can degrade the performance of SWS detection. The results also show that a large and accurately staged sleep dataset is of great importance when developing automatic sleep staging methods.},

The target for DBS and the stimulation parameters to be used are unknown. Here, we implanted bilateral electrodes in the vicinity of the fornix, a key element of the memory circuitry, and applied DBS with different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes in an experimental model of dementia. Rats received scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to mimic memory impairment. Rats were then tested in the object location task with the following conditions: (i) with attachment of stimulation cable (off stimulation), and (ii) with DBS at various amplitudes (50~$\mu$A, 100~$\mu$A and 200~$\mu$A), 100~$\mu$s pulse width and 100~Hz or 10~Hz stimulation frequency. DBS reversed the memory impairing effects of scopolamine when compared to sham rats. We found that the fornix is not sensitive to the frequency of stimulation, but rather to current levels. With the most optimal stimulation parameter, we found no side-effects on anxiety levels and general motor activity. These findings identify the fornix as a key region in controlling spatial memory functions. DBS of this region, using tailored stimulation parameters, has the potential to improve memory functions in conditions characterised by memory impairment.},

  abstract = {Imaging of the brain surface vasculature following inflammatory insults is critical to study structural and functional changes in the living brain under normal and pathological conditions. Although there have been published reports relating to the changes that occur in the blood brain barrier (BBB) during the inflammatory process, the ability to visualize and track such changes in vivo and over time has proven to be problematic. Different techniques have been used to achieve visualization of pial vessels, but the approach has limits, which can jeopardize the well-being of the animals. Development of the cranial window technique provided a major advance in the acquisition of live images of the brain vasculature and its response to different insults and treatments. We describe in detail a protocol for delivery of a localized inflammatory insult to the mouse brain via a craniula (cranial window and adjacent cannula) and subsequent imaging of the mouse brain vasculature by intravital microscopy and two-photon laser scanning microscopy. The surgical implantation of the craniula can be completed in 30-45~min and images can be acquired immediately and for several months thereafter. The technique is minimally invasive and permits serial injections directly to the brain, thereby allowing longitudinal imaging studies. The craniula technique permits the study of structural and functional changes of the BBB following inflammatory insult and as such has wide application to neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genetically engineered calcium and membrane potential indicators provide the potential to estimate the activation dynamics of individual neurons within larger, mesoscale networks (100s-1000+neurons). However, a fully integrated automated workflow for the analysis and visualization of neural microcircuits from high speed fluorescence imaging data is lacking. NEW METHOD: Here we introduce FluoroSNNAP, Fluorescence Single Neuron and Network Analysis Package. FluoroSNNAP is an open-source, interactive software developed in MATLAB for automated quantification of numerous biologically relevant features of both the calcium dynamics of single-cells and network activity patterns. FluoroSNNAP integrates and improves upon existing tools for spike detection, synchronization analysis, and inference of functional connectivity, making it most useful to experimentalists with little or no programming knowledge. RESULTS: We apply FluoroSNNAP to characterize the activity patterns of neuronal microcircuits undergoing developmental maturation in vitro. Separately, we highlight the utility of single-cell analysis for phenotyping a mixed population of neurons expressing a human mutant variant of the microtubule associated protein tau and wild-type tau. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We show the performance of semi-automated cell segmentation using spatiotemporal independent component analysis and significant improvement in detecting calcium transients using a template-based algorithm in comparison to peak-based or wavelet-based detection methods. Our software further enables automated analysis of microcircuits, which is an improvement over existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We expect the dissemination of this software will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of neuronal networks, promoting the rapid interrogation of circuits in health and disease.},

Optogenetics, a technique that genetically targets specific neurons to express light-sensitive channel proteins, provides the capability to control central nervous system neuronal activity in mammals with millisecond time precision. This technique enables precise optical stimulation of neurons and simultaneous monitoring of neural response by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We previously demonstrated, in vitro, the dual capability (optical delivery and electrical recording) while testing a novel hybrid device (optrode-MEA), which incorporates a tapered coaxial optical electrode (optrode) and a 100 element microelectrode array (MEA). Here we report a fully chronic implant of a new version of this device in ChR2-expressing rats, and demonstrate its use in freely moving animals over periods up to 8 months. In its present configuration, we show the device delivering optical excitation to a single cortical site while mapping the neural response from the surrounding 30 channels of the 6 \texttimes{} 6 element MEA, thereby enabling recording of optically modulated single-unit and local field potential activity across several millimeters of the neocortical landscape.},

DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction.},

  abstract = {We describe a real-time electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface system for triaging imagery presented using rapid serial visual presentation. A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

  abstract = {It is often used to analyze epileptic electroencephalograms (EEG) to detect whether there is an epileptic attack. Much research into the state inspection of epileptic seizures has been conducted based on sample entropy (SampEn). However, the study of epileptic seizures based on fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) has lagged behind. New methods: We propose a method of state inspection of epileptic seizures based on FuzzyEn. The method first calculates the FuzzyEn of EEG signals from different epileptic states, and then feature selection is conducted to obtain classification features. Finally, we use the acquired classification features and a grid optimization method to train support vector machines (SVM). Results: The results of two open-EEG datasets in epileptics show that there are major differences between seizure attacks and non-seizure attacks, such that FuzzyEn can be used to detect epilepsy, and our method obtains better classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of classification of the CHB-MIT are 98.31\%, 98.27\% and 98.36\%, and of the Bonn are 100\%, 100\%, 100\%, respectively). Comparisons with existing method(s): To verify the performance of the proposed method, a comparison of the classification performance for epileptic seizures using FuzzyEn and SampEn is conducted. Our method obtains better classification performance, which is superior to the SampEn-based methods currently in use. Conclusions: The results indicate that FuzzyEn is a better index for detecting epileptic seizures effectively. The FuzzyEn-based method is preferable, exhibiting potential desirable applications for medical treatment.},

We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3\%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.},

To achieve the full benefit of these tools requires improved optical systems with high light collection efficiency, high spatial and temporal resolution, and patterned optical stimulation, in a wide field of view (FOV). Here we describe our `Firefly' microscope, which achieves these goals in a \O{}6 mm FOV. The Firefly optical system is optimized for simultaneous photostimulation and fluorescence imaging in cultured cells. All but one of the optical elements are commercially available, yet the microscope achieves 10-fold higher light collection efficiency at its design magnification than the comparable commercially available microscope using the same objective. The Firefly microscope enables all-optical electrophysiology (`Optopatch') in cultured neurons with a throughput and information content unmatched by other neuronal phenotyping systems. This capability opens possibilities in disease modeling and phenotypic drug screening. We also demonstrate applications of the system to voltage and calcium recordings in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.},

Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics, the ability to use light to activate and silence specific neuron types within neural networks in vivo and in vitro, is revolutionizing neuroscientists' capacity to understand how defined neural circuit elements contribute to normal and pathological brain functions. Typically, awake behaving experiments are conducted by inserting an optical fiber into the brain, tethered to a remote laser, or by utilizing an implanted light-emitting diode (LED), tethered to a remote power source. A fully wireless system would enable chronic or longitudinal experiments where long duration tethering is impractical, and would also support high-throughput experimentation. However, the high power requirements of light sources (LEDs, lasers), especially in the context of the extended illumination periods often desired in experiments, precludes battery-powered approaches from being widely applicable. We have developed a headborne device weighing 2 g capable of wirelessly receiving power using a resonant RF power link and storing the energy in an adaptive supercapacitor circuit, which can algorithmically control one or more headborne LEDs via a microcontroller. The device can deliver approximately 2 W of power to the LEDs in steady state, and 4.3 W in bursts. We also present an optional radio transceiver module (1 g) which, when added to the base headborne device, enables real-time updating of light delivery protocols; dozens of devices can be controlled simultaneously from one computer. We demonstrate use of the technology to wirelessly drive cortical control of movement in mice. These devices may serve as prototypes for clinical ultra-precise neural prosthetics that use light as the modality of biological control.},

  abstract = {In statistical connectomics, the quantitative study of brain networks, estimating the mean of a population of graphs based on a sample is a core problem. Often, this problem is especially difficult because the sample or cohort size is relatively small, sometimes even a single subject. While using the element-wise sample mean of the adjacency matrices is a common approach, this method does not exploit any underlying structural properties of the graphs. We propose using a low-rank method which incorporates tools for dimension selection and diagonal augmentation to smooth the estimates and improve performance over the naive methodology for small sample sizes. Theoretical results for the stochastic blockmodel show that this method offers major improvements when there are many vertices. Similarly, we demonstrate that the low-rank methods outperform the standard sample mean for a variety of independent edge distributions as well as human connectome data derived from magnetic resonance imaging, especially when sample sizes are small. Moreover, the low-rank methods yield "eigen-connectomes", which correlate with the lobe-structure of the human brain and superstructures of the mouse brain. These results indicate that low-rank methods are an important part of the tool box for researchers studying populations of graphs in general, and statistical connectomics in particular.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation; \{DBS\}) has become an established treatment for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), and is in trials for refractory epilepsy, headache, and certain mood disorders. Two main themes will advance \{DBS\} significantly in the next five years: closed-loop \{DBS\}, that is, feedback from brain electrical activity to direct the stimulation; and computational analysis (\{CA\})\textemdash{}electrophysiological modeling to enhance \{DBS\}. Closed-loop \{DBS\} is currently in clinical trials for refractory epilepsy. New imaging techniques offer preoperative modeling for \{DBS\} surgery, including nerve fiber tracts (diffusion tensor imaging), and imaging of volume of tissue activated by a specific electrode. \{CA\} techniques for \{DBS\} include mathematical models of the abnormally synchronized electrical activity which underlies epilepsy, movement disorders, and likely many mood disorders as well. By incorporating feedback loops and multiple recording and/or stimulating sites, the abnormally synchronized brain electrical activity can be desynchronized, then ``unlearned'' (``unkindling'' in epilepsy). Characteristics of \{DBS\} utilizing \{CA\} include low frequency rather than high frequency stimulation; multiple stimulation and/or recording sites; likely 10-fold or more reduction in electrical current needs (much smaller ``pulse generators''); more focused and less disruptive stimulation\textemdash{}fewer unwanted side effects; and potential to ``cure'' certain disorders by resetting abnormal firing patterns back to normal. These advantages of more sophisticated \{DBS\} techniques bring the following challenges, which may require a decade of research before reaching clinical practice because many brain disorders involve neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., dopamine in Parkinson's disease and certain mood disorders). Namely, how do we monitor and modulate neurotransmitters in addition to electrical activity? How do we get multiple microelectrodes into the brain in a minimally invasive manner? In the accompanying article, I address these two issues and offer some potential solutions.},

  abstract = {Optical fibers are commonly inserted into living tissues such as the brain in order to deliver light to deep targets for neuroscientific and neuroengineering applications such as optogenetics, in which light is used to activate or silence neurons expressing specific photosensitive proteins. However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets. The 1.45-cm-long probe is microfabricated in the form of a 360-$\mu$m-wide array of 12 parallel silicon oxynitride (SiON) multimode waveguides clad with SiO2 and coated with aluminum; probes of custom dimensions are easily created as well. The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0.4$\pm$0.3dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3.1$\pm$1dB/cm using the outscattering method and 3.2$\pm$0.4dB/cm using the cutback method; corner mirror loss, 1.5$\pm$0.4dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5mW source will deliver over 1.5mW to a target at a depth of 1cm.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of DBS are still unclear, and this lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim thalamus, and the local field potentials (LFPs) generated by the population were used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of DBS amplitude. Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity and tremor (Hua , 1998), (Lenz , 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated LFPs and restore the LFP power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a recursively identified autoregressive model (ARX) of the relationship between stimulation input and LFP output, and showed excellent performances in tracking the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and, differently from open-loop DBS, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The closed-loop controller generated a LFP spectrum that approximated more closely the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum afte- - r a change in the neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility of closed-loop control of DBS amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity present in tremor.},

  abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and Artificial Life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for detecting the location of cells from two-photon calcium imaging data. In our framework, multiple coupled active contours evolve, guided by a model-based cost function, to identify cell boundaries. An active contour seeks to partition a local region into two subregions, a cell interior and exterior, in which all pixels have maximally ``similar'' time courses. This simple, local model allows contours to be evolved predominantly independently. When contours are sufficiently close, their evolution is coupled, in a manner that permits overlap. We illustrate the ability of the proposed method to demix overlapping cells on real data. The proposed framework is flexible, incorporating no prior information regarding a cell's morphology or stereotypical temporal activity, which enables the detection of cells with diverse properties. We demonstrate algorithm performance on a challenging mouse in vitro dataset, containing synchronously spiking cells, and a manually labelled mouse in vivo dataset, on which ABLE (the proposed method) achieves a 67.5\% success rate.},

Yet existing systems either operate on offline snapshots, provide poor consistency guarantees for dynamically changing graphs, or employ expensive concurrency control techniques that limit performance. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph store, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable read-write transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that enables Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain.info, and achieves 12x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.},

  abstract = {A major characteristic of neural networks is the complexity of their organization at various spatial scales, from microscopic local circuits to macroscopic brain-scale areas. Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale coverage (several square millimeters) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50 $\mu$m) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid-deformation-based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

The importance of the human sense of smell has by far been underestimated in the past. Humans and other primates have been regarded as primarily [‘]optical animals' with highly developed powers of vision but a relatively undeveloped sense of smell. In recent years this assumption has undergone major revision. Several studies indicate that humans indeed seem to use olfactory communication and are even able to produce and perceive certain pheromones; recent studies have found that pheromones may play an important role in the behavioural and reproduction biology of humans. In this article we review the present evidence of the effect of human pheromones and discuss the role of olfactory cues in human sexual behaviour./p},

  abstract = {Neural engineering, itself an 'emerging interdisciplinary research area' [1] has undergone a sea change over the past few years with the emergence of exciting new optical technologies for monitoring, stimulating, inhibiting and, more generally, modulating neural activity. To a large extent, this change is driven by the realization of the promise and complementary strengths that emerging photo-stimulation tools offer to add to the neural engineer's toolbox, which has been almost exclusively based on electrical stimulation technologies. Notably, photo-stimulation is non-contact, can in some cases be genetically targeted to specific cell populations, can achieve high spatial specificity (cellular or even sub-cellular) in two or three dimensions, and opens up the possibility of large-scale spatial\textendash{}temporal patterned stimulation. It also offers a seamless solution to the problem of cross-talk generated by simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording. As in other biomedical optics phenomena [2], photo-stimulation includes multiple possible modes of interaction between light and the target neurons, including a variety of photo-physical and photo-bio\textendash{}chemical effects with various intrinsic components or exogenous 'sensitizers' which can be loaded into the tissue or genetically expressed. Early isolated reports of neural excitation with light date back to the late 19th century [3] and to Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis' work five decades ago [4]; however, the mechanism by which these and other direct photo-stimulation, inhibition and modulation events [5\textendash{}7] took place is yet unclear, as is their short- and long-term safety profile. Photo-chemical photolysis of covalently 'caged' neurotransmitters [8, 9] has been widely used in cellular neuroscience research for three decades, including for exciting or inhibiting neural activity, and for mapping neural circuits. Technological developments now allow neurotransmitters to be uncaged with exquisite spatial specificity (down to a single spine, with two-photon uncaging) and in rapid, flexible spatial\textendash{}temporal patterns [10\textendash{}14]. Nevertheless, current technology generally requires damaging doses of UV or violet illumination and the continuous re-introduction of the caged compound, which, despite interest, makes for a difficult transition beyond in vitro preparations. Thus, the tremendous progress in the in vivo application of photo-stimulation tools over the past five years has been largely facilitated by two 'exciting' new photo-stimulation technologies: photo-biological stimulation of a rapidly increasing arsenal of light-sensitive ion channels and pumps ('optogenetic' probes[15\textendash{}18]) and direct photo-thermal stimulation of neural tissue with an IR laser [19\textendash{}21]. The Journal of Neural Engineering has dedicated a special section in this issue to highlight advances in optical stimulation technology, which includes original peer-reviewed contributions dealing with the design of modern optical systems for spatial\textendash{}temporal control of optical excitation patterns and with the biophysics of neural\textendash{}thermal interaction mediated by electromagnetic waves. The paper by Nikolenko, Peterka and Yuste [22] presents a compact design of a microscope-photo-stimulator based on a transmissive phase-modulating spatial-light modulator (SLM). Computer-generated holographic photo-stimulation using SLMs [12\textendash{}14, 23] allows the efficient parallel projection of intense sparse patterns of light, and the welcome development of compact, user-friendly systems will likely reduce the barrier to its widespread adoption. The paper by Losavio et al [24] presents the design and functional characteristics of their acousto-optical deflector (AOD) systems for studying spatial\textendash{}temporal dendritic integration in single neurons in vitro. Both single-photon (UV) and two-photon (femtosecond pulsed IR) AOD uncaging systems are described in detail. The paper presents an excellent overview of the current state of the art and limitations of this technology, which is increasingly being applied for both photo- stimulation and imaging [25, 26]. Finally, the paper by Pikov et al [27] studies the modulatory biophysical effects exerted by low power millimeter waves on neuronal excitability and membrane properties of cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro. These extensive neuro-modulatory effects seem to include a thermal component (related to the photo-thermal effects observed under laser illumination [28]) as well as a more specific effect exerted by these lower frequency (sub-THz) electromagnetic waves. These new contributions augment five previous manuscripts published by the journal on optical stimulation technology, which reported the development of a fiber-based system for in vivo optogenetic cortical stimulation [29], patterned stimulation systems based on computer-generated holography [23] and on arrays of micro-LEDs [30] designed for an optical retina neuroprosthetic [31], and an integrated system for optical stimulation with microelectrode array recording [32]. Without doubt, many more will quickly follow as neural engineers and neuroscientists increasingly tackle the many challenges that this exciting area poses. We can all expect to hear much more in the near future about the biophysics and implementation of photo-physical neural-interaction mechanisms, the design of new optogenetic probes and patterned-stimulation systems (including stand-alone and implantable systems), further integration of electrodes and optical components into electro-optical neurostimulation systems, and rapid progress towards multiple medical applications for alleviating neurological disabilities and improving human health.

  abstract = {Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBT) neural circuits are critical modulators of cognitive and motor function. When compromised, these circuits contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, motor deficits correlate with the emergence of exaggerated beta frequency (15-30 Hz) oscillations throughout the CBT network. However, little is known about how specific cell types within individual CBT brain regions support the generation, propagation, and interaction of oscillatory dynamics throughout the CBT circuit or how specific oscillatory dynamics are related to motor function. Here, we investigated the role of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SChIs) in generating beta and gamma oscillations in cortical-striatal circuits and in influencing movement behavior. We found that selective stimulation of SChIs via optogenetics in normal mice robustly and reversibly amplified beta and gamma oscillations that are supported by distinct mechanisms within striatal-cortical circuits. Whereas beta oscillations are supported robustly in the striatum and all layers of primary motor cortex (M1) through a muscarinic-receptor mediated mechanism, gamma oscillations are largely restricted to the striatum and the deeper layers of M1. Finally, SChI activation led to parkinsonianlike motor deficits in otherwise normal mice. These results highlight the important role of striatal cholinergic interneurons in supporting oscillations in the CBT network that are closely related to movement and parkinsonian motor symptoms.},

  abstract = {Under natural viewing conditions, small movements of the eye, head and body prevent the maintenance of a steady direction of gaze. It is known that stimuli tend to fade when they are stabilized on the retina for several seconds. However, it is unclear whether the physiological motion of the retinal image serves a visual purpose during the brief periods of natural visual fixation. This study examines the impact of fixational instability on the statistics of the visual input to the retina and on the structure of neural activity in the early visual system. We show that fixational instability introduces a component in the retinal input signals that, in the presence of natural images, lacks spatial correlations. This component strongly influences neural activity in a model of the LGN. It decorrelates cell responses even if the contrast sensitivity functions of simulated cells are not perfectly tuned to counter-balance the power-law spectrum of natural images. A decorrelation of neural activity at the early stages of the visual system has been proposed to be beneficial for discarding statistical redundancies in the input signals. The results of this study suggest that fixational instability might contribute to the establishment of efficient representations of natural stimuli.},

The relative intensity of light reflected from brain tissue into the other optic fiber was monitored with a photomultiplier and ink-writing recorder. Different brain structures were shown to vary in the amount of reflectance, with white matter having much higher reflectance than gray matter. It was demonstrated in a total of 239 penetrations that the patterns of successive changes in the reflected light response, as the probe was lowered into the brain, was characteristic for each frontal plane.

OpenVX is an emerging standard for supporting workloads in which such algorithms are applied. OpenVX uses a graph-based software architecture designed to enable efficient computation on heterogeneous platforms that may include CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and other accelerators. Unfortunately, in settings where real-time constraints exist, the usage of OpenVX poses certain challenges. In a recent paper, the authors presented a new implementation of OpenVX directed at platforms comprised of CPUs and GPUs that leverages various analytical techniques to enable these challenges to be addressed. In this paper, these analytical techniques are presented and discussed in detail. These techniques enable end-to-end frame processing times to be analytically bounded under OpenVX while encouraging parallelism through pipelining. Additionally, they enable bounds on frame buffering requirements to be determined. \&copy; 2015 ACM.},

  abstract = {Standard video frame interpolation methods first estimate optical flow between input frames and then synthesize an intermediate frame guided by motion. Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.},

  abstract = {Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom. They can change their conformation from a resting state to a signalling state upon light absorption, which activates the G protein, thereby resulting in a signalling cascade that produces physiological responses. This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction. Recent cloning techniques have revealed the rich and diverse nature of these molecules, found in organisms ranging from jellyfish to humans, functioning in visual and non-visual phototransduction systems and photoisomerases. Here we describe the diversity of these proteins and their role in phototransduction. Then we explore the molecular properties of opsins, by analysing site-directed mutants, strategically designed by phylogenetic comparison. This site-directed mutant approach led us to identify many key features in the evolution of the photoreceptor molecules. In particular, we will discuss the evolution of the counterion, the reduction of agonist binding to the receptor, and the molecular properties that characterize rod opsins apart from cone opsins. We will show how the advances in molecular biology and biophysics have given us insights into how evolution works at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning, as part of a wider set of machine learning methods, consists of layers of integrated computations and comparisons to draw correlations from many different representations of data and is inherently highly compute intensive. In stride with the advancements of CPU technology on core count and speed, the time to compute or process these data representations has decreased and is further mitigated by the use of parallel computing techniques. But as we scale out this parallel compute we start to hit the limits of what commodity and even standard enterprise servers can support to the point that pushing for more cores begins to require custom solutions to chip-set support, CPU inter-connectivity, and power consumption. This can be extremely cost intensive and, depending on your data sets and associated revenues, may not deliver the best value of cost to compute. Advances in compute technologies may have caused a recent resurgence of interest in Deep Learning, in particular Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology. There are many options in the GPU space and the compute architecture of these cores are highly suited for floating point number crunching as well as the Matrix and Vector mathematics involved in Deep Learning. In our work evaluating how different framework algorithms utilize compute hardware for Deep Learning we tested several different GPU supporting servers from several vendors. This integrated system cluster required us to make careful hardware selections. In this Workshop, we, as the Performance Engineering Group (PEG), will describe our experience with Deep Learning Software and Hardware Objectives at Yahoo, as well as the selection and installation of hardware and software for research purposes for Yahoo Engineering Teams.},

  abstract = {Information theory provides a principled and unified statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables (Ince et al., 2016a). This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni- and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods is available at: https://github.com/robince/gcmi We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We demonstrate the benefits of a multivariate statistical approach with examples such as MEG vector magnetic fields (including separate quantification of stimulus modulations of amplitude and direction) as well as considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a two-dimensional response. A particular advantage of the information theoretic framework is its ability to quantify representational interactions between different neuroimaging responses: for example, different cortical regions, frequency bands, time periods or recording modalities (i.e. simultaneous recorded EEG and fMRI). Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals. By combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space EEG data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information (DFI), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can accelerate diverse classes of applications, such as recognition, gaming, data analytics, weather prediction, and multimedia. Many of these applications are amenable to approximate execution. This application characteristic provides an opportunity to improve GPU performance and efficiency. Among approximation techniques, neural accelerators have been shown to provide significant performance and efficiency gains when augmenting CPU processors. However, the integration of neural accelerators within a GPU processor has remained unexplored. GPUs are, in a sense, many-core accelerators that exploit large degrees of data-level parallelism in the applications through the SIMT execution model. This paper aims to harmoniously bring neural and GPU accelerators together without hindering SIMT execution or adding excessive hardware overhead. We introduce a low overhead neurally accelerated architecture for GPUs, called NGPU, that enables scalable integration of neural accelerators for large number of GPU cores. This work also devises a mechanism that controls the tradeoff between the quality of results and the benefits from neural acceleration. Compared to the baseline GPU architecture, cycle-accurate simulation results for NGPU show a 2.4\texttimes{} average speedup and a 2.8\texttimes{} average energy reduction within 10\% quality loss margin across a diverse set of benchmarks. The proposed quality control mechanism retains a 1.9\texttimes{} average speedup and a 2.1\texttimes{} energy reduction while reducing the degradation in the quality of results to 2.5\%. These benefits are achieved by less than 1\% area overhead.},

A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to \{MEG\} planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked \{EEG\} responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/\{EEG\} signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

  abstract = {This work is a follow-up study based on previous research. The study presents a novel approach for effective production of mass micro holes. Initially, a set of micro w-EDM mechanisms is designed and mounted on the developed precise tabletop CNC machine tool to fabricate the micro electrode array. The tension of the micro wire is precisely controlled by a magnetic force. Furthermore, micro vibrations of the wire during discharging are effectively suppressed by the developed vibration suppression system. To fabricate the mass micro holes, a microstructure array with a high-aspect ratio of 10 10 micro squared electrodes, width and height of 21 $\mu$m and 700 $\mu$m, respectively, for each electrode and 24 $\mu$m spacing between two electrodes is fabricated first by using the proposed reverse w-EDM machining strategy. The electrodes array is directly utilized to drill the mass micro holes by bath micro EDM on the same machine. An array of 900 through-holes of the same size is successfully fabricated via the modified peck-drilling method on a 30 $\mu$m thick stainless-steel plate. A tip at the free end of the micro electrode is designed and fabricated as a circular-pyramid shape. Experimental results verified that the spiky end form eliminates debris adhering to the edges of the micro holes. Analytical results demonstrate satisfactory hole geometric accuracy, dimensional accuracy and surface roughness. Furthermore, mass micro holes can be fabricated efficiently using the proposed technique.},

  abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of classical feedback control methods to achieve an improved deep brain stimulation (DBS) algorithm for application to Parkinson's disease (PD). Approach. A computational model of PD dynamics was employed to develop model-based rational feedback controller design. The restoration of thalamocortical relay capabilities to patients suffering from PD is formulated as a feedback control problem with the DBS waveform serving as the control input. Two high-level control strategies are tested: one that is driven by an online estimate of thalamic reliability, and another that acts to eliminate substantial decreases in the inhibition from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) to the thalamus. Control laws inspired by traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) methodology are prescribed for each strategy and simulated on this computational model of the basal ganglia network. Main Results. For control based upon thalamic reliability, a strategy of frequency proportional control with proportional bias delivered the optimal control achieved for a given energy expenditure. In comparison, control based upon synaptic inhibitory output from the GPi performed very well in comparison with those of reliability-based control, with considerable further reduction in energy expenditure relative to that of open-loop DBS. The best controller performance was amplitude proportional with derivative control and integral bias, which is full PID control. We demonstrated how optimizing the three components of PID control is feasible in this setting, although the complexity of these optimization functions argues for adaptive methods in implementation. Significance. Our findings point to the potential value of model-based rational design of feedback controllers for Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers are focusing on a new use of the Internet called the Internet of Things (IoT), in which enabled electronic devices can be remotely accessed over the Internet. As the realization of IoT concept is still in its early stages, manufacturers of Internet-connected devices and IoT web service providers are defining their proprietary protocols based on their targeted applications. Consequently, IoT becomes heterogeneous in terms of hardware capabilities and communication protocols. Addressing these heterogeneities by following open standards is a necessary step to communicate with various IoT devices. In this research, we assess the feasibility of applying existing open standards on resource-constrained IoT devices. The standard protocols developed in this research are OGC PUCK over Bluetooth, TinySOS, SOS over CoAP, and OGC SensorThings API. We believe that by hosting open standard protocols on IoT devices, not only do the devices become self-describable, self-contained, and interoperable, but innovative applications can also be easily developed with standardized interfaces. In addition, we use memory consumption, request message size, response message size, and response latency to benchmark the efficiency of the implemented protocols. In all, this research presents and evaluates standard-based solutions to better understand the feasibility of applying existing standards to the IoT vision.},

This two-way communication allows us to monitor the state of the brain and its composite networks and cells as well as to influence them to treat disease or repair/restore sensory or motor function. To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.

  abstract = {The amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family (ARF), which was not related to other known proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors. The archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions; H+ pump (bacteriorhodopsin), Cl- pump (halorhodopsin), and two kinds of sensor (sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin). These four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplication(s) before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea, based on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea. By comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree, we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin:halorhodopsin:sensory rhodopsin: phoborhodopsin to be 5:4:3:10. From these values, the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred. The branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping. Using bacteriorhodopsin (and halorhodopsin) as an outgroup, the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsin/phoborhodopsin was determined. By calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point, we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin. The evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin, which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin, and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations. The changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps.},

This device enables high-speed cellular imaging across $\sim$0.5 mm2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca2+ spiking in 200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca2+ spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales.

The Firefly optical system is optimized for simultaneous photostimulation and fluorescence imaging in cultured cells. All but one of the optical elements are commercially available, yet the microscope achieves 10-fold higher light collection efficiency at its design magnification than the comparable commercially available microscope using the same objective. The Firefly microscope enables all-optical electrophysiology (`Optopatch') in cultured neurons with a throughput and information content unmatched by other neuronal phenotyping systems. This capability opens possibilities in disease modeling and phenotypic drug screening.

  abstract = {Background We investigated the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) for treatment refractory depression. Methods Fifteen patients with chronic, severe, highly refractory depression received open-label DBS at three collaborating clinical sites. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the VC/VS region. Stimulation was titrated to therapeutic benefit and the absence of adverse effects. All patients received continuous stimulation and were followed for a minimum of 6 months to longer than 4 years. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\textemdash{}24 item (HDRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF). Results Significant improvements in depressive symptoms were observed during DBS treatment. Mean HDRS scores declined from 33.1 at baseline to 17.5 at 6 months and 14.3 at last follow-up. Similar improvements were seen with the MADRS (34.8, 17.9, and 15.7, respectively) and the GAF (43.4, 55.5, and 61.8, respectively). Responder rates with the HDRS were 40\% at 6 months and 53.3\% at last follow-up (MADRS: 46.7\% and 53.3\%, respectively). Remission rates were 20\% at 6 months and 40\% at last follow-up with the HDRS (MADRS: 26.6\% and 33.3\%, respectively). The DBS was well-tolerated in this group. Conclusions Deep brain stimulation of the VC/VS offers promise for the treatment of refractory major depression.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor signs affecting gait, postural stability, and tremor. These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency (100\hspace{0.6em}Hz). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) onset or cessation affects PD signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during DBS, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all PD patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on PD and none exploring the effect of DBS was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during DBS, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by DBS-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of DBS effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in PD.},

The statistical theory based on such relations between individual objects can be called algorithmic statistics, in contrast to classical statistical theory that deals with relations between probabilistic ensembles. We develop the algorithmic theory of statistic, sufficient statistic, and minimal sufficient statistic. This theory is based on two-part codes consisting of the code for the statistic (the model summarizing the regularity, the meaningful information, in the data) and the model-to-data code. In contrast to the situation in probabilistic statistical theory, the algorithmic relation of (minimal) sufficiency is an absolute relation between the individual model and the individual data sample. We distinguish implicit and explicit descriptions of the models. We give characterizations of algorithmic (Kolmogorov) minimal sufficient statistic for all data samples for both description modes--in the explicit mode under some constraints. We also strengthen and elaborate earlier results on the ``Kolmogorov structure function'' and ``absolutely non-stochastic objects''--those rare objects for which the simplest models that summarize their relevant information (minimal sufficient statistics) are at least as complex as the objects themselves. We demonstrate a close relation between the probabilistic notions and the algorithmic ones.},

Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether RPCs will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99\% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87\% accuracy. Our implementation can segment, track and generate predictions for 40 cells simultaneously on a standard computer at 5 min per frame.

  abstract = {Background A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson's Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson's disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data\textendash{}large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources\textendash{}all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data.

Methods and Findings Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson's disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96\%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting.

Conclusions Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson's disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80\%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or \{MEAs\}) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (\{LFP\}) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with \{NeuroRighter\}, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

  abstract = {Microelectrode recording (MER) is an important navigational and investigational tool, specifically with regard to deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. MER is often utilized when targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other deep brain nuclei in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), tremor, dystonia and other emerging applications. Microelectrodes are used to detect and measure cellular spiking activity while macroelectrodes are considered more suitable for measuring the collective sum of slow potentials from multiple cells near the electrode, the local field potential (LFP). Precisely how the characteristics of an electrode affect the data recorded is still unclear. Technical idiosyncrasies of some surgical cases allowed serendipitous data collection from a 250 to 6000 Hz bandpassed macroelectrode recording during DBS implantation for PD. Simultaneous recording from both a microelectrode and macroelectrode were compared along the same surgical trajectory. Audio, normalized root mean square of the recorded signal, and power spectrograms were used to analyze the data. The analyses demonstrate similar results in detecting cellular spiking activity when recording with macroelectrodes compared with microelectrodes. This has important implications for the standardization of recording electrophysiological data as well as for the development of next generation closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems.},

Resulting cell subline (U-937/PF) cultured in protein-free medium was characterized by immunological, cytochemical and biochemical techniques. There were no major differences in immunophenotype (determined by FACS analysis with monoclonal antibodies directed to HLA and CD antigens) and cytochemical markers between the U-937/PF cells cultured in protein-free cell culture medium and parental U-937 cell cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Maximal cell density was slightly decreased in protein-free culture as compared to the parental cell line in FCS-supplemented medium. Cell viability and cell DNA histograms (determined by propidium iodide cytofluorimetry) showed no major differences between parental U-937 and U-937/PF cells. Phorbol ester (TPA)-induction of differentiation-associated cell markers resulted in a proliferation arrest and accumulation of G0/G1 cells in both sublines. All-trans retinoic acid and, to a lesser extent, TPA-stimulated NBT reduction was higher in parental U-937 cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium as compared to U-937/PF cells. Quantitative differences in the expression and inducibility of some cytochemical markers (beta-glucuronidase, chloroacetate esterase) were found between both examined sublines. Described U-937/PF subline cultured in a protein-free cell culture medium (PFH) appeared as a potential tool for studies of in vitro inducing agents and serum components with differentiation promoting (or inhibiting) activities.},

He-Ne laser (633 nm) was used to simulate the physical therapy in in vivo skin tissue. Under the cylinder coordinates, the three-dimension (3-D) geometry of tissue was reduced to two-dimension (2-D) computation. The results contained the radial, axial and temperature 3-D color plot. Combining the time animation display was possible. By changing the laser and tissue parameters we can get different results.

  abstract = {Light control of motility behavior (phototaxis and photophobic responses) in green flagellate algae is mediated by sensory rhodopsins homologous to phototaxis receptors and light-driven ion transporters in prokaryotic organisms. In the phototaxis process, excitation of the algal sensory rhodopsins leads to generation of transmembrane photoreceptor currents. When expressed in animal cells, the algal phototaxis receptors function as light-gated cation channels, which has earned them the name ``channelrhodopsins.'' Channelrhodopsins have become useful molecular tools for light control of cellular activity. Only four channelrhodopsins, identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, have been reported so far. By screening light-induced currents among algal species, we identified that the phylogenetically distant flagellate Mesostigma viride showed photoelectrical responses in vivo with properties suggesting a channelrhodopsin especially promising for optogenetic use. We cloned an M. viride channelrhodopsin, MChR1, and studied its channel activity upon heterologous expression. Action spectra in HEK293 cells match those of the photocurrents observed in M. viride cells. Comparison of the more divergent MChR1 sequence to the previously studied phylogenetically clustered homologs and study of several MChR1 mutants refine our understanding of the sequence determinants of channelrhodopsin function. We found that MChR1 has the most red-shifted and pH-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins' channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination. This combination of properties makes MChR1 a promising candidate for optogenetic applications. IMPORTANCE Channelrhodopsins that function as phototaxis receptors in flagellate algae have recently come into the spotlight as genetically encoded single-molecule optical switches for turning on neuronal firing or other cellular processes, a technique called ``optogenetics.'' Only one of four currently known channelrhodopsins is widely used in optogenetics, although electrical currents recorded in diverse flagellates suggest the existence of a large variety of such proteins. We applied a strategy for the search for new channelrhodopsins with desirable characteristics by measuring rhodopsin-mediated photocurrents in microalgae, which helped us identify MChR1, a new member of the channelrhodopsin family. MChR1 exhibits several sought-after characteristics and thus expands the available optogenetic toolbox. The divergence of the MChR1 sequence from those of the four known channelrhodopsins contributes to our understanding of diversity in the primary structures of this subfamily of sensory rhodopsins.},

  abstract = {The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables X i . It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the X i . We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

  abstract = {Connotation and Denotation Connotation and Denotation are two principal methods of describing the meanings of words. Connotation refers to the wide array of positive and negative associations that most words naturally carry with them, whereas denotation is the precise, literal definition of a word that might be found in a dictionary. Cars of the 1960's Thunderbird, Falcon, Charger, Comet, Mustang, Barracuda. Cars of the 1970's Rabbit, Pinto, Colt, Civic, Starlet, Gremlin. Introduce the idea of connotation, defining it as the associations that people make with a word. You can contrast connotation with the denotative value of a word, its more literal meaning, and give an example of a word (such as "chicken") Connotation is the emotional and imaginative association surrounding a word. Denotation is the strict dictionary meaning of a word. Visiting Seema Srivastava's Argumentative Writing class recently, I witnessed a very useful exercise for teaching students the difference between connotation and denotation. Under the rubric of teaching students about Pathos, or appeal to emotion, in the Aristotelian Pathos/Ethos/Logos triangle, she briefly described denotation as the literal meaning and connotation as the emotional weight of a word, comparing cheap to inexpensive as an example. She noted that non-native speakers often have difficulty with connotation, while native speakers may use the words appropriately though unconsciously. She then presented students the following groups of words and asked them to rank the words in order from positive to negative.},

  abstract = {A great number of biomedical and analytical applications require the detection of light; this includes chemiluminescence, bioluminescence, and fluorescence as well as many others. These applications require the use of a detector to convert light into an electrical signal, and to accomplish this there are three basic technologies: photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and photodiodes. Photomultipliers are discussed in a separate document. When to use a particular detector is not always that straightforward to determine. A photodiode is suitable in applications where there is plenty of light available. In applications with very weak signals, a photomultiplier is the best choice. But there are applications where the choice is not clear. Focusing on solid-state options, this note reviews solid-state detector characteristics and the criteria for detector and amplifier selection. The silicon photodiode},

  abstract = {Rolling element linear motion bearings are widely used to guide, support, locate, and accurately move machinery components and products in a wide range of automation applications. Rolling element linear bearings and guides provide low friction, smooth, accurate motion for nearly any moment or normal loading condition. Major applications include factory automation, medical, packaging, machine tool, semiconductor, printing, automotive assembly, aerospace and food processing. Specifying the right bearing for a given application is necessary to save time and excessive costs. Understanding the tradeoffs of each bearing type is important to accurately size and select the right bearing for your application. Choosing an inadequate solution can lead to higher costs in design, surface preparation, materials, assembly, and bearing maintenance. Or worse, it can lead to insufficient machine accuracy, repeatability, and life, requiring an entirely new type of linear guide. This article will provide an overview of the major types of linear bearings and guides, explain how to specify them for specific applications and describe how to trouble-shoot common application problems. Types of bearings and guides Figure 1: Comparative strengths of different bearing types Designers have a wide range of bearing and guide alternatives for providing accurate linear motion. The chart above provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the major types of plain contact sliding and re-circulating rolling element bearings. For example, the chart shows that bronze bushings have high load capacity and low accuracy while profile rail linear guides have high load capacity and medium accuracy.},

An IR blocking filter, integrated on-chip and localized to the color sensing photodiodes, minimizes the IR spectral component of the incoming light and allows color measurements to be made accurately. The high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and IR blocking filter make the TCS3472 an ideal color sensor solution for use under varying lighting conditions and through attenuating materials. The TCS3472 color sensor has a wide range of applications including RGB LED backlight control, solid-state lighting, health/fitness products, industrial process controls and medical diagnostic equipment. In addition, the IR blocking filter enables the TCS3472 to perform ambient light sensing (ALS). Ambient light sensing is widely used in display-based products such as cell phones, notebooks, and TVs to sense the lighting environment and enable automatic display brightness for optimal viewing and power savings. The TCS3472, itself, can enter a lower-power wait state between light sensing measurements to further reduce the average power consumption. r},

  abstract = {Platinum-based materials play an important role as electrocatalysts in energy conversion technologies. Graphene-supported Pt nanoclusters were recently found to be promising electrocatalysts for fuel-cell applications due to their enhanced activity and tolerance to CO poisoning as well as their long-term stability toward sintering. However, structure-function relationships that underpin the improved performance of these catalysts are still not well understood. Here, we employ a combination of empirical potential simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate structure-function relationships of small Pt N (N = 2-80) clusters on model carbon (graphene) supports. A bond-order empirical potential is employed within a genetic algorithm to go beyond local optimizations in obtaining minimum-energy structures of Pt N clusters on pristine as well as defective graphene supports. Point defects in graphene strongly anchor Pt clusters and also appreciably affect the morphologies of small clusters, which are characterized via various structural metrics such as the radius of gyration, average bond length, and average coordination number. A key finding from the structural analysis is that the fraction of potentially active surface sites in supported clusters is maximized for stable Pt clusters in the size range of 20-30 atoms, which provides a useful design criterion for optimal utilization of the precious metal. Through selected ab initio studies, we find a consistent trend for charge transfer from small Pt clusters to defective graphene supports resulting in the lowering of the cluster d-band center, which has implications for the overall activity and poisoning of the catalyst. The combination of a robust empirical potential-based genetic algorithm for structural optimization with ab initio calculations opens up avenues for systematic studies of supported catalyst clusters at much larger system sizes than are accessible to purely ab initio approaches.},

  abstract = {High frequency deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (deep brain stimulation, \{DBS\}) relieves many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in humans and animal models. Although the treatment has seen widespread use, its therapeutic mechanism remains paradoxical. The subthalamic nucleus is excitatory, so its stimulation at rates higher than its normal firing rate should worsen the disease by increasing subthalamic excitation of the globus pallidus. The therapeutic effectiveness of \{DBS\} is also frequency and intensity sensitive, and the stimulation must be periodic; aperiodic stimulation at the same mean rate is ineffective. These requirements are not adequately explained by existing models, whether based on firing rate changes or on reduced bursting. Here we report modeling studies suggesting that high frequency periodic excitation of the subthalamic nucleus may act by desynchronizing the firing of neurons in the globus pallidus, rather than by changing the firing rate or pattern of individual cells. Globus pallidus neurons are normally desynchronized, but their activity becomes correlated in Parkinson's disease. Periodic stimulation may induce chaotic desynchronization by interacting with the intrinsic oscillatory mechanism of globus pallidus neurons. Our modeling results suggest a mechanism of action of \{DBS\} and a pathophysiology of Parkinsonism in which synchrony, rather than firing rate, is the critical pathological feature.},

However, new tools are being pursued to elicit a presynaptic calcium influx that triggers the release of neurotransmitters, most of them based in calcium-permeable Channelrhodopsin-2 mutants. Here we describe a method to control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles through the use of a light-gated glutamate receptor (LiGluR), which has recently been demonstrated that supports secretion by means of calcium influx in chromaffin cells. Expression of LiGluR in hippocampal neurons enables reversible control of neurotransmission with light, and allows modulating the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron with the wavelength of illumination. This method may be useful for the determination of the complex transfer function of individual synapses.},

DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction.},

Each $\mu$\{LED\} and recording site has dimensions similar to a pyramidal neuron soma, providing confined emission and electrophysiological recording of action potentials and local field activity. We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12~$\mu$\{LEDs\} and 32 recording sites, into the \{CA\}1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 \{nW\} light~power, and fast population oscillations were induced~at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells $\sim$50~$\mu$m apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

  abstract = {Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom. They can change their conformation from a resting state to a signalling state upon light absorption, which activates the G protein, thereby resulting in a signalling cascade that produces physiological responses. This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction. Recent cloning techniques have revealed the rich and diverse nature of these molecules, found in organisms ranging from jellyfish to humans, functioning in visual and non-visual phototransduction systems and photoisomerases. Here we describe the diversity of these proteins and their role in phototransduction. Then we explore the molecular properties of opsins, by analysing site-directed mutants, strategically designed by phylogenetic comparison. This site-directed mutant approach led us to identify many key features in the evolution of the photoreceptor molecules. In particular, we will discuss the evolution of the counterion, the reduction of agonist binding to the receptor, and the molecular properties that characterize rod opsins apart from cone opsins. We will show how the advances in molecular biology and biophysics have given us insights into how evolution works at the molecular level.},

Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, depression and addiction.

However, the mechanisms underlying \{DBS\} effects remain enigmatic and are the subject of an ongoing debate. Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for \{PD\} in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (\{MPTP\}) primate model of \{PD\}. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (\{BG\}) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into \{PD\} pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop \{DBS\} and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop \{DBS\} paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the \{BG\}-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced \{PD\}. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.},

  abstract = {Sensory-driven behaviors engage a cascade of cortical regions to process sensory input and generate motor output. To investigate the temporal dynamics of neural activity at this global scale, we have developed methods to perform functional imaging across large areas of cortex using a transgenic mouse expressing GCaMP6s, integrated with a head-fixed visual discrimination behavior. This technique allows imaging of activity across the dorsal surface of cortex at a spatial resolution of approximately 50$\mu$m and temporal resolution of approximately 100 msec. Imaging during an orientation discrimination task reveals a progression of activity in different cortical regions associated with different phases of the task. After cortex-wide patterns of activity are determined, we demonstrate the ability to select a region that displayed conspicuous responses for two-photon microscopy, and find that activity in populations of individual neurons there correlates with locomotion in trained mice. We expect that this paradigm will be a useful probe of information flow and network processing in brain-wide circuits involved in many sensory and cognitive processes.},

  abstract = {The ability to optimize behavioural performance when confronted with continuously evolving environmental demands is a key element of human cognition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making, monitoring for conflict between competing responses and predicting task difficulty. Precise mechanisms of dACC function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual dACC neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current dACC activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect, is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the dACC. Our results demonstrate that the dACC provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future behavioural responses. In situations with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses.},

Recent improvements in high performance fluorescent sensors and scientific CMOS cameras enables optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale. While exciting technical advances demonstrate the potential of this technique, further improvement in data acquisition and analysis, especially those that allow effective processing of increasingly larger datasets, would greatly promote the application of optical imaging in systems neuroscience. Here we demonstrate the ability of wide-field imaging to capture the concurrent dynamic activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons over millimeters of brain tissue in behaving mice. This system allows the visualization of morphological details at a higher spatial resolution than has been previously achieved using similar functional imaging modalities. To analyze the expansive data sets, we developed software to facilitate rapid downstream data processing. Using this system, we show that a large fraction of anatomically distinct hippocampal neurons respond to discrete environmental stimuli associated with classical conditioning, and that the observed temporal dynamics of transient calcium signals are sufficient for exploring certain spatiotemporal features of large neural networks.},

Efforts to tackle this problem have been hampered by the scarcity of markers that can be used to predict cell division outcomes. Here we present a computational method, based on algorithmic information theory, to analyze dynamic features of living cells over time. Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether RPCs will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99\% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87\% accuracy. Our implementation can segment, track and generate predictions for 40 cells simultaneously on a standard computer at 5 min per frame. This method could be used to isolate cell populations with specific developmental potential, enabling previously impossible investigations.},

Distribution or reproduction of this work in whole or in part requires full attribution of the original publication, including its DOI. Imaging of mesoscale brain activity is used to map interactions between brain regions. This work has benefited from the pioneering studies of Grinvald et al., who employed optical methods to image brain function by exploiting the properties of intrinsic optical signals and small molecule voltage-sensitive dyes. Mesoscale interareal brain imaging techniques have been advanced by cell targeted and selective recombinant indicators of neuronal activity. Spontaneous resting state activity is often collected during mesoscale imaging to provide the basis for mapping of connectivity relationships using correlation. However, the information content of mesoscale datasets is vast and is only superficially presented in manuscripts given the need to constrain measurements to a fixed set of frequencies, regions of interest, and other parameters. We describe a new open source tool written in python, termed mesoscale brain explorer (MBE), which provides an interface to process and explore these large datasets. The platform supports automated image processing pipelines with the ability to assess multiple trials and combine data from different animals. The tool provides functions for temporal filtering, averaging, and visualization of functional connectivity relations using time-dependent correlation. Here, we describe the tool and show applications, where previously published datasets were reanalyzed using MBE.},

  abstract = {Research and innovation are constant imperatives for the healthcare sector: medicine, biology and biotechnology support it, and more recently computational and data-driven disciplines gained relevance to handle the massive amount of data this sector is and will be generating. To be effective in translational and healthcare industrial research, big data in the life science domain need to be organized, well annotated, catalogued, correlated and integrated: the biggest the data silos at hand, the stronger the need for organization and tidiness. The degree of such organization marks the transition from data to knowledge for strategic decision making. Thus the challenge for the use of big data in industrial research is the possibility to have effective and coherent data annotation, aimed at integration of heterogeneous domains such as different OMICs and non-OMICs (traditional) data sources. Holistic approaches enabling an acknowledged management of big data, often driven by machine learning methods, can thus trigger a change of industrial research accelerating the process from discovery to product delivery. For instance, the main pillars of industrial R\&D processes for vaccines or drug development, include initial discovery, early - late pre clinics, pre-industrialization, clinical phases and finally registration - commercialization. The passage from one step to another is regulated by stringent pass/fail criteria. Bottlenecks of the R\&D process are often represented by animal and human studies, which could be rationalized by surrogate in vitro assays as well as by predictive molecular and cellular signatures and models. The impact of big data in healthcare industrial research is to address such bottlenecks by providing actionable information and new knowledge so as to accelerate the development process in a cost effective way. Case studies will be discussed for the effective use of electronic health records, the leverage of network analysis methods for drug repurposing and the development of vaccines towards human pathologies.},

Compared with previous works using voxel-based media discretization, a mesh-based approach can be more accurate in modeling targets with curved boundaries or locally refined structures. We implement an efficient ray-tracing technique using Pl\"ucker Coordinates. The Barycentric coordinates computed from Pl\"ucker-formed ray-tracing enables us to use linear Lagrange basis functions to model both media properties and fluence distribution, leading to further improvement in accuracy. The Pl\"ucker-coordinate ray-polygon intersection test can be extended to hexahedral or high-order elements. Excellent agreement is found when comparing mesh-based MC with the analytical diffusion model and 3D voxel-based MC code in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. Realistic time-resolved imaging results are observed for a complex human brain anatomy using mesh-based MC. We also include multi-threading support in the software and will port it to a graphics processing unit platform in the near future.},

  abstract = {Catadioptric imaging systems use curved mirrors to capture wide fields of view. However, due to the curvature of the mirror, these systems tend to have very limited depth of field (DOF), with the point spread function (PSF) varying dramatically over the field of view and as a function of scene depth. In recent years, focal sweep has been used extensively to extend the DOF of conventional imaging systems. It has been shown that focal sweep produces an integrated point spread function (IPSF) that is nearly space-invariant and depth-invariant, enabling the recovery of an extended depth of field (EDOF) image by deconvolving the captured focal sweep image with a single IPSF. In this paper, we use focal sweep to extend the DOF of a catadioptric imaging system. We show that while the IPSF is spatially varying when a curved mirror is used, it remains quasi depth-invariant over the wide field of view of the imaging system. We have developed a focal sweep system where mirrors of different shapes can be used to capture wide field of view EDOF images. In particular, we show experimental results using spherical and paraboloidal mirrors.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the baseline optical properties of the tissues of the human head is essential for absolute cerebral oximetry, and for quantitative studies of brain activation. In this work we numerically model the utility of signals from a small 6-optode time-resolved diffuse optical tomographic apparatus for inferring baseline scattering and absorption coefficients of the scalp, skull and brain, when complete geometric information is available from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use an optical model where MRI-segmented tissues are assumed homogeneous. We introduce a noise model capturing both photon shot noise and forward model numerical accuracy, and use Bayesian inference to predict errorbars and correlations on the measurments. We also sample from the full posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We conclude that \{$\backslash$textasciitilde\} 106 detected photons are sufficient to measure the brain's scattering and absorption to a few percent. We present preliminary results using a fast multi-layer slab model, comparing the case when layer thicknesses are known versus unknown.},

  abstract = {Saccade planning may invoke spatially-specific feedback signals that bias early visual activity in favor of top-down goals. We tested this hypothesis by measuring cortical activity at the early stages of the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams. Human subjects maintained saccade plans to (prosaccade) or away (antisaccade) from a spatial location over long memory-delays. Results show that cortical activity persists in early visual cortex at the retinotopic location of upcoming saccade goals. Topographically specific activity persists as early as V1, and activity increases along both dorsal (V3A/B, IPS0) and ventral (hV4, VO1) visual areas. Importantly, activity persists when saccade goals are available only via working memory and when visual targets and saccade goals are spatially disassociated. We conclude that top-down signals elicit retinotopically specific activity in visual cortex both in the dorsal and ventral streams. Such activity may underlie mechanisms that prioritize locations of task-relevant objects.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila or C. elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called FlyPi. Our design is based on a 3-D printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under 100 Euros and features optional modules for LED-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs \~200 Euros, or substantially less if the user is prepared to shop around. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPis capabilities we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPis utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres and research labs.},

  abstract = {Optical fibers are commonly inserted into living tissues such as the brain in order to deliver light to deep targets for neuroscientific and neuroengineering applications such as optogenetics, in which light is used to activate or silence neurons expressing specific photosensitive proteins. However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets. The 1.45-cm-long probe is microfabricated in the form of a 360-$\mu$m-wide array of 12 parallel silicon oxynitride (SiON) multimode waveguides clad with SiO2 and coated with aluminum; probes of custom dimensions are easily created as well. The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0.4$\pm$0.3dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3.1$\pm$1dB/cm using the outscattering method and 3.2$\pm$0.4dB/cm using the cutback method; corner mirror loss, 1.5$\pm$0.4dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5mW source will deliver over 1.5mW to a target at a depth of 1cm.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Smoking and overeating are compulsory habits that are difficult to stop. Several studies have shown involvement of the nucleus accumbens in these and other addictive behaviors. In this case report, we describe a patient who quit smoking and lost weight without any effort, and we review the underlying mechanisms of action.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, nicotine dependence, and obesity.

INTERVENTION

The patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Unintended, effortless, and simultaneous smoking cessation and weight loss were observed.

CONCLUSION

This study supports the idea of compulsivity with common circuitry in the processing of diverse rewards and suggests that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens could be a possible treatment of patients with a dependency not responding to currently available treatments.},

Analytical calculations and finite-difference simulations based on diffusion theory are compared with discrete-ordinate, finite-difference transport calculations. The influence of the ratio of absorption and transport scattering coefficient on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation are quantified and different definitions for the diffusion coefficient, D, are discussed. We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium. Based on results for simple homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, we analyse diffusion and transport calculation of light propagation in the human brain. For these simulations we convert density maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to optical-parameter maps ( and ) of the brain. We show that diffusion theory fails to describe accurately light propagation in highly absorbing regions, such as haematoma, and void-like spaces, such as the ventricles and the subarachnoid space.},

Here, we report a method for long-term imaging of a GECI, GCaMP6f, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors in cortical neurons of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate. We used a tetracycline-inducible expression system to robustly amplify neuronal GCaMP6f expression and up- and downregulate it for more than 100~days. We succeeded in monitoring spontaneous activity not only from hundreds of neurons three-dimensionally distributed in layers 2 and 3 but also from single dendrites and axons in~layer 1. Furthermore, we detected selective activities from somata, dendrites, and axons in the somatosensory cortex responding to specific tactile stimuli. Our results provide a way to investigate the organization and plasticity of cortical microcircuits at subcellular resolution in non-human primates.},

However, BCI still faces a critical hurdle, in that performance varies greatly across and even within subjects, an obstacle that degrades the reliability of BCI systems. Understanding the causes of these problems is important if we are to create more stable systems. In this short review, we report the most recent studies and findings on performance variation, especially in motor imagery-based BCI, which has found that low-performance groups have a less-developed brain network that is incapable of motor imagery. Further, psychological and physiological states influence performance variation within subjects. We propose a possible strategic approach to deal with this variation, which may contribute to improving the reliability of BCI. In addition, the limitations of current work and opportunities for future studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is important to test the attitude control systems on satellites before they are launched in space. Traditionally this has been done by dropping the satellite, and firing the thrusters before the satellite makes a soft landing in a net. This method only allows a few seconds of testing and does not lend itself to the measurement of pointing accuracy. A better method is to mount the satellite on a spherical air bearing. This provides a frictionless pivot with three degrees of freedom. Servo loop stability, response time, and pointing accuracy can be determined. In order for this concept to work, the composite center of gravity of the rotating system must be coincident with the center of rotation of the air bearing. There are three basic techniques for accomplishing this: (1) counterbalancing the satellite, (2) using a shallow spherical bearing with a center of rotation considerably above the mounting surface, and (3) splitting the satellite in half and placing each half on the side of the sphere which is supported on a film of air. This paper describes a number of spherical air bearing ""space simulators"" in detail, and outlines the fundamental concepts of this type of testing.},

  abstract = {Energy is an important consideration in the design and deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since sensor nodes are typically powered by batteries with limited capacity. Since the communication unit on a wireless sensor node is the major power consumer, data compression is one of possible techniques that can help reduce the amount of data exchanged between wireless sensor nodes resulting in power saving. However, wireless sensor networks possess significant limitations in communication, processing, storage, bandwidth, and power. Thus, any data compression scheme proposed for WSNs must be lightweight. In this paper, we present an adaptive lossless data compression (ALDC) algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Our proposed ALDC scheme performs compression losslessly using multiple code options. Adaptive compression schemes allow compression to dynamically adjust to a changing source. The data sequence to be compressed is partitioned into blocks, and the optimal compression scheme is applied for each block. Using various real-world sensor datasets we demonstrate the merits of our proposed compression algorithm in comparison with other recently proposed lossless compression algorithms for WSNs.},

  abstract = {Scientific simulations typically store only a small fraction of computed timesteps due to storage and I/O bandwidth limitations. Previous work has demonstrated the compressibility of floating-point volume data, but such compression often comes with a tradeoff between computational complexity and the achievable compression ratio. This work demonstrates the use of special-purpose video encoding hardware on the GPU which is present but (to the best of our knowledge) completely unused in current GPU-equipped super computers such as Titan. We show that lossy encoding allows the output of far more data at sufficient quality for a posteriori rendering and analysis. We also show that the encoding can be computed in parallel to general-purpose computation due to the special-purpose hardware. Finally, we demonstrate such encoded volumes are inexpensive to decode in memory during analysis, making it unnecessary to ever store the decompressed volumes on disk.},

  abstract = {Chronically implantable, closed-loop neuromodulation devices with concurrent sensing and stimulation hold promise for better understanding the nervous system and improving therapies for neurological disease. Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

  abstract = {4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9) is an inducible costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T and natural killer (NK) cells. 4-1BB ligation on T cells triggers a signaling cascade that results in upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules, cytokine secretion, and enhanced effector function. In dysfunctional T cells that have a decreased cytotoxic capacity, 4-1BB ligation demonstrates a potent ability to restore effector functions. On NK cells, 4-1BB signaling can increase antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting 4-1BB have been developed to harness 4-1BB signaling for cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical results in a variety of induced and spontaneous tumor models suggest that targeting 4-1BB with agonist antibodies can lead to tumor clearance and durable anti-tumor immunity. Clinical trials of two agonist antibodies, urelumab and utomilumab, are ongoing. Despite initial signs of efficacy, clinical development of urelumab has been hampered by inflammatory liver toxicity at doses above 1 mg/kg. Utomilumab has a superior safety profile, but is a less potent 4-1BB agonist relative to urelumab. Both antibodies have demonstrated promising results in patients with lymphoma and are currently being tested in combination therapy trials with other immunomodulatory agents.

The measurement elements of an optical BCI consist of sets of optical sources and detectors. Our current system utilises sources which comprise of dual wavelength light emitting diodes (LED) at 760nm and 880nm. An optical analysis demonstrated that NIR radiation is a negligible source of heating in this case. LED heat conduction however is a major source of heating, and LEDs, though much safer than laser diodes, have been known to cause burns if improperly used. We describe a procedure by which we measure the heat conduction effect of LEDs. We show that the LED systems used in our current generation BCI produce safe levels of thermal energy and are within published safety levels.},

  abstract = {Interactive live-streaming applications and platforms face particular challenges: the actions of the viewer's affect the content of the stream. A minimal capture-render delay is critical. This is the case of applications, such as remote laboratories, which allow students to view specific hardware through a webcam, and interact with it remotely in close to real time. It is also the case of other applications, such as videoconferencing or remote rendering. In the latest years, several commercial live-streaming platforms have appeared. However, the most of them have two significant limitations. First, because they are oriented toward standard live-streaming, their capture-render delay tends to be too high for interactive live-streaming. Second, their architectures and sources are closed. That makes them unsuitable for many research and practical purposes, especially when customization is required. This paper presents the requirements for an interactive live-streaming platform, focusing on remote lab needs as a case study. Then, it proposes an architecture to satisfy those requirements that relies on Redis to achieve high scalability. The architecture is based on open technologies, and has been implemented and published as open source. From a client-side perspective, it is web-based and mobile-friendly. It is intended to be useful for both research and practical purposes. Finally, this paper experimentally evaluates the proposed architecture through its contributed implementation, analyzing its performance and scalability.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons' neighbors \textemdash{} whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away \textemdash{} must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

Analytical calculations and finite-difference simulations based on diffusion theory are compared with discrete-ordinate, finite-difference transport calculations. The influence of the ratio of absorption and transport scattering coefficient on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation are quantified and different definitions for the diffusion coefficient, D, are discussed. We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium. Based on results for simple homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, we analyse diffusion and transport calculation of light propagation in the human brain. For these simulations we convert density maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to optical-parameter maps ( and ) of the brain. We show that diffusion theory fails to describe accurately light propagation in highly absorbing regions, such as haematoma, and void-like spaces, such as the ventricles and the subarachnoid space.},

  abstract = {Light control of motility behavior (phototaxis and photophobic responses) in green flagellate algae is mediated by sensory rhodopsins homologous to phototaxis receptors and light-driven ion transporters in prokaryotic organisms. In the phototaxis process, excitation of the algal sensory rhodopsins leads to generation of transmembrane photoreceptor currents. When expressed in animal cells, the algal phototaxis receptors function as light-gated cation channels, which has earned them the name ``channelrhodopsins.'' Channelrhodopsins have become useful molecular tools for light control of cellular activity. Only four channelrhodopsins, identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, have been reported so far. By screening light-induced currents among algal species, we identified that the phylogenetically distant flagellate Mesostigma viride showed photoelectrical responses in vivo with properties suggesting a channelrhodopsin especially promising for optogenetic use. We cloned an M. viride channelrhodopsin, \{MChR\}1, and studied its channel activity upon heterologous expression. Action spectra in \{HEK\}293 cells match those of the photocurrents observed in M. viride cells. Comparison of the more divergent \{MChR\}1 sequence to the previously studied phylogenetically clustered homologs and study of several \{MChR\}1 mutants refine our understanding of the sequence determinants of channelrhodopsin function. We found that \{MChR\}1 has the most red-shifted and \{pH\}-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins' channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination. This combination of properties makes \{MChR\}1 a promising candidate for optogenetic applications. \{IMPORTANCE\} Channelrhodopsins that function as phototaxis receptors in flagellate algae have recently come into the spotlight as genetically encoded single-molecule optical switches for turning on neuronal firing or other cellular processes, a technique called ``optogenetics.'' Only one of four currently known channelrhodopsins is widely used in optogenetics, although electrical currents recorded in diverse flagellates suggest the existence of a large variety of such proteins. We applied a strategy for the search for new channelrhodopsins with desirable characteristics by measuring rhodopsin-mediated photocurrents in microalgae, which helped us identify \{MChR\}1, a new member of the channelrhodopsin family. \{MChR\}1 exhibits several sought-after characteristics and thus expands the available optogenetic toolbox. The divergence of the \{MChR\}1 sequence from those of the four known channelrhodopsins contributes to our understanding of diversity in the primary structures of this subfamily of sensory rhodopsins.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for a number of movement disorders. This has prompted investigation of its use for other applications including psychiatric disorders. In recent years, DBS has been introduced for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts or ideas (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in order to relieve these obsessions (compulsions). Abnormal activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus has been implicated in OCD. To this end a number of DBS targets including the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), ventral caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been investigated for the treatment of OCD. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in movement disorders, the mechanism of DBS is not fully understood, especially as it relates to psychiatric disorders. While initially thought to create a functional lesion akin to ablative procedures, it is increasingly clear that DBS may induce clinical benefit through activation of axonal fibers spanning the CSTC circuits, alteration of oscillatory activity within this network, and/or release of critical neurotransmitters. In this article we review how the use of DBS for OCD informs our understanding of both the mechanisms of DBS and the circuitry of OCD. We review the literature on DBS for OCD and discuss potential mechanisms of action at the neuronal level as well as the broader circuit level.},

With a constantly advancing body of evidence and increasing availability, applications of PET/CT in CRC are likely to emerge in therapy response assessment, radiotherapy planning, use of novel tracers and `one-stop' imaging techniques such as iodinated contrast-enhanced PET/CT. With the use of illustrative clinical examples, this article reviews the utility of FDG PET/CT in the management of CRC, discussing its role and limitations in the multimodality imaging of these patients.},

  abstract = {This article is the first in a five-part series, "Developing cognitive IoT solutions for anomaly detection by using deep learning." This article explains what deep learning is, what neural networks are, and how they can be used to analyze the large amount of data that IoT sensors gather. Although predictions are always controversial, Gartner says that there are 8.4 billion connected IoT devices in 2017 (not counting smartphones) and some analysts say that by 2020 there will be 50 billion. Even if over-estimated, soon the number of IoT devices will exceed the number of humans on the planet. And guess what, all these devices are continuously generating data; data that is useless unless you can analyze it. A cognitive system provides a set of technological capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, machine learning, and advanced machine learning to help with analyzing all that data. Cognitive systems can learn and interact naturally with humans to gather insights from data and help you to make better decisions. In my last article I stated cognitive computing is not just human-computer interaction (HCI), it is advanced machine learning driven by powerful algorithms (models) and nearly unlimited data processing capabilities. To understand a cognitive system that uses IoT sensors and deep learning analysis, you first need to understand the leap from advanced machine learning to neural networks. In this article, I try to help you make that leap. In the coming weeks, I will present three different tutorials about anomaly detection on time-series data on Apache Spark using the Deeplearning4j, ApacheSystemML, and TensorFlow (TensorSpark) deep learning frameworks to help you fully understand how to develop cognitive IoT solutions for anomaly detection by using deep learning.},

  abstract = {From measurements of change in conductivity with electron irradiation of thin n-type germanium samples at 79$^\circ$K, a threshold energy for the formation of stable acceptor centers has been determined. It is found to be 355$\pm$5 kev, corresponding to 15.1 ev for the lightest mass germaniumisotope at rest. Taking into account the contribution of lattice vibrations to the displacement energy the threshold is $\sim$16 ev. An orientation dependence has been found in the rate of formation of the centers in agreement with the predictions of Kohn. In order of decreasing rate of center formation the three orientations examined are (111), (110), (100). There is no corresponding orientation dependence in the threshold energy itself. The energy dependence of the rate of acceptor formation suggests the defects are not the closest vacancy-interstitial pairs. A positive temperature dependence of the rate of acceptor formation has been found. This effect is largest at lowest electron energies. It is not explicable by lattice vibrations, although they can contribute to the effect between 79$^\circ$K and room temperature. The apparent threshold changes by $\sim$100 kev between 21 and 263$^\circ$K.},

  abstract = {As arrays increase their pixel numbers and mosaics of arrays become more prevalent, the volume of data being produced per night is increasing rapidly. As we look forward to the LSST era, where 30TB of data per night will be produced, streamlined and rapid data reduction processes are becoming critical. Recent developments in the computer industry have led to the production of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) which can contain hundreds of processing cores, each of which can process hundreds of threads concurrently. Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform has allowed developers to take advantage of these modern GPUs and design massively parallel algorithms which can provide huge speed-ups of up to around a factor of 100 over CPU implementations. Data pipelines are perfectly suited to reap the benefits of massive parallelization because many of the algorithms in data processing are performed on a per-pixel basis on ever larger sets of images. In addition, the PyCUDA (a href='http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda'http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/a) module and python native C-API allow for CUDA code to be easily integrated into python code. Python has continued to gain momentum in the astronomical community, particularly as an attractive alternative to IDL or C code for data pipelines. Thus, the ability to link GPU-optimized CUDA code directly into python allows for existing data pipeline frameworks to be reused with new parallel algorithms. We present the initial results of parallelizing many of the more CPU-intensive algorithms in the Florida Analysis Tool Born Of Yearning for high quality scientific data (FATBOY) and discuss the implications for the future of data pipelines. We use an Nvidia 580 GTX GPU for our tests and find that the 580 GTX produces a speed-up of anywhere from a factor of around 10 up to a factor of 300 over CPU implementations for individual routines. We believe that it is possible to obtain an overall pipeline speed gain of a factor of 10-25 over traditionally built data pipelines. A speed gain of this magnitude would for the first time allow for near real-time data processing - data sets that previously required hours to process could be reduced in minutes concurrent with continuing observations, considerably optimizing the observational process.},

To date, no studies have explored the neural correlates associated with increases in cognitive load whilst performing a motor task in patients with freezing. In this experiment, 14 PD patients with and 15 PD patients without freezing of gait underwent 3T fMRI while performing a virtual reality gait task. Directions to walk and stop were presented on the viewing screen as either direct cues or as more cognitively indirect pre-learned cues. Both groups showed a consistent pattern of BOLD response within the Cognitive Control Network during performance of the paradigm. However, a between group comparison revealed that those PD patients with freezing of gait were less able to recruit the bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area, as well as the left subthalamic nucleus when responding to indirect cognitive cues whilst maintaining a motor output. These results suggest that PD patients with freezing of gait are unable to properly recruit specific cortical and subcortical regions within the Cognitive Control Network during the performance of simultaneous motor and cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {We propose a framework for general multiple target tracking, where the input is a set of candidate regions in each frame, as obtained from a state of the art background learning, and the goal is to recover trajectories of targets over time from noisy observations. Due to occlusions by targets and static objects, noisy segmentation and false alarms, one foreground region may not correspond to one target faithfully. Therefore the one-to-one assumption used in most data association algorithm is not always satisfied. Our method overcomes the one-to-one assumption by formulating the visual tracking problem in terms of finding the best spatial and temporal association of observations, which maximizes the consistency of both motion and appearance of trajectories. To avoid enumerating all possible solutions, we take a Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) approach to sample the solution space efficiently. The sampling is driven by an informed proposal scheme controlled by a joint probability model combining motion and appearance. To make sure the Markov chain to converge to a desired distribution, we propose an automatic approach to determine the parameters in the target distribution. Comparative experiments with quantitative evaluations are provided.},

  abstract = {Nanomedicines have enormous potential to improve the precision of cancer therapy, yet our ability to efficiently home these materials to regions of disease in vivo remains very limited. Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of `signalling' modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted `receiving' nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.},

  abstract = {We present two techniques to improve landmark localization in images from partially annotated datasets. Our primary goal is to leverage the common situation where precise landmark locations are only provided for a small data subset, but where class labels for classification or regression tasks related to the landmarks are more abundantly available. First, we propose the framework of sequential multitasking and explore it here through an architecture for landmark localization where training with class labels acts as an auxiliary signal to guide the landmark localization on unlabeled data. A key aspect of our approach is that errors can be backpropagated through a complete landmark localization model. Second, we propose and explore an unsupervised learning technique for landmark localization based on having a model predict equivariant landmarks with respect to transformations applied to the image. We show that these techniques, improve landmark prediction considerably and can learn effective detectors even when only a small fraction of the dataset has landmark labels. We present results on two toy datasets and four real datasets, with hands and faces, and report new state-of-the-art on two datasets in the wild, e.g. with only 5$\backslash$\% of labeled images we outperform previous state-of-the-art trained on the AFLW dataset.},

  abstract = {The thesis of this chapter is that the unconscious (basic) craving process, consisting of activation within limbic incentive motivation and memory systems, is ultimately responsible for relapse behaviors. The chapter first includes a brief discussion of current clinical conceptions of craving. This is followed by an argument for what aspect of human craving animals may experience. This leads to a description of various animal models (primarily using rats) that indirectly measure activity of a basic craving mechanism. A final section is provided with examples of the utility of animal models of craving illustrated with translational evidence. It is argued that basic craving is amenable to study by animal models of craving that measure motivated drug seeking behavior. Furthermore, reflection on a distinction between conscious (subjective) craving and basic craving leads to the following possible conclusions: one could treat the conscious craving and this would provide some benefit to the addict. But what would remain is the basic craving response to drug-paired stimuli, situations, and even drug-focused thought processes. Reducing basic craving using pharmaco- or behavioral therapies based upon animal model findings may ultimately be more effective at reducing relapse behaviors.},

  abstract = {Summary In~vivo calcium imaging using a 1-photon-based miniscope and a microendoscopic lens enables studies of neural activities in freely behaving animals. However, the high and fluctuating background, the inevitable movements and distortions of imaging field, and the extensive spatial overlaps of fluorescent signals emitted from imaged neurons inherent in this 1-photon imaging method present major challenges for extracting neuronal signals reliably and automatically from the raw imaging data. Here, we develop a unifying algorithm called the miniscope 1-photon imaging pipeline (MIN1PIPE), which contains several stand-alone modules and can handle a wide range of imaging conditions and qualities with minimal parameter tuning and automatically and accurately isolate spatially localized neural signals. We have quantitatively compared MIN1PIPE with other existing partial methods using both synthetic and real datasets obtained from different animal models and show that MIN1PIPE has superior efficiency and precision in analyzing noisy miniscope calcium imaging data.},

How do we gain insight into the dynamic processes of disease and development from terabytes of multidimensional image data? Here I describe a collaborative approach to extracting meaning from biological imaging data. The collaboration consists of teams of biologists and engineers working together. Custom computational tools are built to best exploit application-specific knowledge in order to visualize and analyze large and complex data sets. The image data are summarized, extracting and modeling the features that capture the objects and relationships in the data. The summarization is validated, the results visualized, and errors corrected as needed. Finally, the customized analysis and visualization tools together with the image data and the summarization results are shared. This Perspective provides a brief guide to the mathematical ideas that rigorously quantify the notion of extracting meaning from biological image, and to the practical approaches that have been used to apply these ideas to a wide range of applications in cell and tissue optical imaging.},

  abstract = {Ca2+imaging techniques permit time-lapse recordings of neuronal activity from large populations over weeks. However, without identifying the same neurons across imaging sessions (cell registration), longitudinal analysis of the neural code is restricted to population-level statistics. Accurate cell registration becomes challenging with increased numbers of cells, sessions, and inter-session intervals. Current cell registration practices, whether manual or automatic, do not quantitatively evaluate registration accuracy, possibly leading to data misinterpretation. We developed a probabilistic method that automatically registers cells across multiple sessions and estimates the registration confidence for each registered cell. Using large-scale Ca2+imaging data recorded over weeks from the hippocampus and cortex of freely behaving mice, we show that our method performs more accurate registration than previously used routines, yielding estimated error rates 5\%, and that the registration is scalable for many sessions. Thus, our method allows reliable longitudinal analysis of the same neurons over long time periods. Sheintuch et al. present a probabilistic method for tracking the same neurons across multiple days (cell registration) in large-scale Ca2+imaging data recorded from behaving mice. The probabilities for pairs of neighboring cells from different sessions to be the same neuron are estimated and utilized to perform reliable cell registration.},

At its core, impulsivity arises through an inability to adequately suppress or inhibit inappropriate behaviour and by a general intolerance to delayed gratification, a tendency also widely found in abstinent drug addicts. Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine (`state impulsivity') potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead `trait impulsivity' and brain disorders linked to it \textendash{} for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \textendash{} predispose to drug use and addiction.

The information dimension, which measures the rate at which the information contained in a probability density scales with resolution, fills a logical gap in the classification of attractors in terms of metric entropy, fractal dimension, and topological entropy. Several examples are presented of chaotic attractors that have a self similar, geometrically scaling structure in their probability distribution; for these attractors the information dimension and fractal dimension are different. Just as the metric (Kolmogorov-Sinai) entropy places an upper bound on the information gained in a sequence of measurements, the information dimension can be used to estimate the information obtained in an isolated measurement. The metric entropy can be expressed in terms of the information dimension of a probability distribution constructed from a sequence of measurements. An algorithm is presented that allows the experimental determination of the information dimension and metric entropy},

In the phototaxis process, excitation of the algal sensory rhodopsins leads to generation of transmembrane photoreceptor currents. When expressed in animal cells, the algal phototaxis receptors function as light-gated cation channels, which has earned them the name ``channelrhodopsins.'' Channelrhodopsins have become useful molecular tools for light control of cellular activity. Only four channelrhodopsins, identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, have been reported so far. By screening light-induced currents among algal species, we identified that the phylogenetically distant flagellate Mesostigma viride showed photoelectrical responses in vivo with properties suggesting a channelrhodopsin especially promising for optogenetic use. We cloned an M. viride channelrhodopsin, MChR1, and studied its channel activity upon heterologous expression. Action spectra in HEK293 cells match those of the photocurrents observed in M. viride cells. Comparison of the more divergent MChR1 sequence to the previously studied phylogenetically clustered homologs and study of several MChR1 mutants refine our understanding of the sequence determinants of channelrhodopsin function. We found that MChR1 has the most red-shifted and pH-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins' channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination. This combination of properties makes MChR1 a promising candidate for optogenetic applications. IMPORTANCE Channelrhodopsins that function as phototaxis receptors in flagellate algae have recently come into the spotlight as genetically encoded single-molecule optical switches for turning on neuronal firing or other cellular processes, a technique called ``optogenetics.'' Only one of four currently known channelrhodopsins is widely used in optogenetics, although electrical currents recorded in diverse flagellates suggest the existence of a large variety of such proteins. We applied a strategy for the search for new channelrhodopsins with desirable characteristics by measuring rhodopsin-mediated photocurrents in microalgae, which helped us identify MChR1, a new member of the channelrhodopsin family. MChR1 exhibits several sought-after characteristics and thus expands the available optogenetic toolbox. The divergence of the MChR1 sequence from those of the four known channelrhodopsins contributes to our understanding of diversity in the primary structures of this subfamily of sensory rhodopsins.},

  abstract = {Hybrid voltage sensors (hVoS) probe membrane potential by coupling the fluorescence of membrane-anchored proteins to the movement of a membrane-embedded hydrophobic anion dipicrylamine. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer~between these two components transduces voltage changes into fluorescence changes, providing a signal for imaging electrical activity in genetically targeted cells. To improve hVoS signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting motifs, and linkages of fluorescent proteins to optimize the normalized fluorescence change ($\Delta$F/F) and signal/noise ratio. The best results were obtained with cerulean fluorescent protein tagged N-terminally with a GAP43 motif and C-terminally with a truncated h-ras motif. With 100 mV steps in PC12 cells, this probe produced $\Delta$F/F = 26\% (4 $\mu$M dipicrylamine), which was threefold greater than that obtained with the original farnesylated EGFP construct. We also obtained a fivefold greater signal/noise ratio, which was 70\% of a theoretical optimum. We designate this GAP43-CerFP-t-h-ras construct as hVoS 2.0. With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that hVoS 2.0 places its fluorophore $\sim$40 \AA{} from the bilayer midplane. hVoS 2.0 performed well in cultured hippocampal neurons, where single action potentials produced clear fluorescence changes in a single trial. This improved probe should help investigators image voltage in genetically targeted neurons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia. Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate. RESULTS: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. CONCLUSIONS: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. We combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be corrected to 100\% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable. Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.},

The real-time system (RTS) concept was implementing is based on rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) on an ATmega328P microcontroller. Three infrared line sensors were used as input for controlling two direct current (DC) motors. A RTS software was programmed in Arduino IDE which relied on a real-time operating system (RTOS) of ChibiOS/RT library. Three independent tasks of software functions were created for testing real-time scheduling capability and the result of temporal scope was collected. The microcontroller succeeded to handle multiple tasks without missed their dateline. This implementation of the RTOS in embedded system for mobile robotics system is hoped to increase students understanding and learning capability.},

  abstract = {The mouse is an increasingly prominent model for the analysis of mammalian neuronal circuits. Neural circuits ultimately have to be probed during behaviors that engage the circuits. Linking circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates, to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced. Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction. Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at approximately 80\% of initial weight. At that point mice were trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session. Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking). Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and whole cell recordings.},

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity but implementations require suitable (normal) compression algorithms. We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image. The proposed algorithm is compared with several other methods.},

  abstract = {Motivated by experiments employing optogenetic stimulation of cortical regions, we consider spike control strategies for ensembles of uncoupled integrate and fire neurons with a common conductance input. We construct strategies for control of spike patterns, that is, multineuron trains of action potentials, up to some maximal spike rate determined by the neural biophysics. We emphasize a constructive role for parameter heterogeneity, and find a simple rule for controllability in pairs of neurons. In particular, we determine parameters for which common drive is not limited to inducing synchronous spiking. For large ensembles, we determine how the number of controllable neurons varies with the number of observed (recorded) neurons, and what collateral spiking occurs in the full ensemble during control of the subensemble. While complete control of spiking in every neuron is not possible with a single input, we find that a degree of subensemble control is made possible by exploiting dynamical heterogeneity. As most available technologies for neural stimulation are underactuated, in the sense that the number of target neurons far exceeds the number of independent channels of stimulation, these results suggest partial control strategies that may be important in the development of sensory neuroprosthetics and other neurocontrol applications.},

  abstract = {Background: Binocular rivalry is a perceptual phenomenon that arises when two incompatible images are presented separately, one to each eye, and the observer experiences involuntary perceptual alternations between the two images. If the two images are flickering at two distinct frequencies, electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to track the frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) driven by each image as they compete for awareness, providing an objective measure of the subjective perceptual state. This spontaneous alternation in perceptual dominance is believed to be driven by neural processes across widespread regions in the brain, but the real-time mechanisms of these processes remain unclear. New Method: The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of investigating binocular rivalry using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach in order to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high spatial resolution of fMRI. Results: We have developed novel techniques for artifact removal and signal optimization for the rivalry-related SSVEP data collected simultaneously during fMRI. Comparison with Existing Methods: Our methods address several significant technical challenges of recording SSVEP data in the noisy fMRI environment, and enabled us to successfully reconstruct SSVEP signatures of rivalry in a group of healthy human subjects. Conclusion: Further development and application of these techniques will enable more comprehensive integration of EEG and fMRI data collected simultaneously and could have significant implications for EEG-fMRI studies of brain activity in general.},

  abstract = {Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that control the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials (APs). Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Malfunction of an ion channel's sensing or gating module can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation of the nervous system with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently being evaluated as a potential therapy in improving memory functions in Alzheimer's disease. The target for DBS and the stimulation parameters to be used are unknown. Here, we implanted bilateral electrodes in the vicinity of the fornix, a key element of the memory circuitry, and applied DBS with different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes in an experimental model of dementia. Rats received scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to mimic memory impairment. Rats were then tested in the object location task with the following conditions: (i) with attachment of stimulation cable (off stimulation), and (ii) with DBS at various amplitudes (50~$\mu$A, 100~$\mu$A and 200~$\mu$A), 100~$\mu$s pulse width and 100~Hz or 10~Hz stimulation frequency. DBS reversed the memory impairing effects of scopolamine when compared to sham rats. We found that the fornix is not sensitive to the frequency of stimulation, but rather to current levels. With the most optimal stimulation parameter, we found no side-effects on anxiety levels and general motor activity. These findings identify the fornix as a key region in controlling spatial memory functions. DBS of this region, using tailored stimulation parameters, has the potential to improve memory functions in conditions characterised by memory impairment.},

  abstract = {The current Food and Drug Administration approved system for the treatment of tremor disorders through Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the area of the brain that controls movement, operates open-loop. It does not automatically adapt to the instantaneous patient's needs or to the progression of the disease. This paper demonstrates an adaptive closed-loop controlled DBS that, after switching off stimulation, tracks few physiological signals to predict the reappearance of tremor before the patient experiences discomfort, at which point it instructs the DBS controller to switch on stimulation again. The core of the proposed approach is a Neural Network (NN) which effectively extracts tremor predictive information from non-invasively recorded surface-electromyogram(sEMG) and accelerometer signals measured at the symptomatic extremities. A simple feed-forward back-propagation NN architecture is shown to successfully predict tremor in 31 out of 33 trials in two Parkinson's Disease patients with an overall accuracy of 75.8\% and sensitivity of 92.3\%. This work therefore shows that closed-loop DBS control is feasible in the near future and that it can be achieved without modifications of the electrodes implanted in the brain, i.e., is backward compatible with approved DBS systems.},

The pacemaker converges to the sinoatrial region during development and comprises fewer than a dozen cells by the time the heart loops. Perturbation of the activity of these cells was entirely reversible, demonstrating the resilience of the endogenous pacemaker.

Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.},

  abstract = {The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the Xi. We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

  abstract = {Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris\textendash{}Lecar (M\textendash{}L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control.},

At the same time, tens-of-thousands of computational algorithms are developed and reported in the literature along with thousands of software tools and services. Users demand intuitive, quick and platform-agnostic access to data, software tools, and infrastructure from millions of hardware devices. This explosion of information, scientific techniques, computational models, and technological advances leads to enormous challenges in data analysis, evidence-based biomedical inference and reproducibility of findings., The Pipeline workflow environment provides a crowd-based distributed solution for consistent management of these heterogeneous resources. The Pipeline allows multiple (local) clients and (remote) servers to connect, exchange protocols, control the execution, monitor the states of different tools or hardware, and share complete protocols as portable XML workflows. In this paper, we demonstrate several advanced computational neuroimaging and genetics case-studies, and end-to-end pipeline solutions. These are implemented as graphical workflow protocols in the context of analyzing imaging (sMRI, fMRI, DTI), phenotypic (demographic, clinical), and genetic (SNP) data.},

We present constant time algorithms for volume estimations in streams and sliding windows, which are faster than previous work. Our solutions are formally analyzed and are extensively evaluated over multiple real-world packet traces as well as synthetic ones. For streams, we demonstrate a run-time improvement of up to 2.4X compared to the state of the art. On sliding windows, we exhibit a memory reduction of over 100X on all traces and an asymptotic runtime improvement to a constant. Finally, we apply our approach to hierarchical heavy hitters and achieve an empirical 2.4-7X speedup.},

  abstract = {Accurately detecting hidden clinical or behavioral states from sequential measurements is an emerging topic in neuroscience and medicine, which may dramatically impact neural prosthetics, brain \#x2013;computer interface and drug delivery. For example, early detection of an epileptic seizure from sequential electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements would allow timely administration of anticonvulsant drugs or neurostimulation, thus reducing physical impairment and risks of overtreatment. We develop a Bayesian paradigm for state transition detection that combines optimal control and Markov processes. We define a hidden Markov model of the state evolution and develop a detection policy that minimizes a loss function of both probability of false positives and accuracy (i.e., lag between estimated and actual transition time). Our strategy automatically adapts to each newly acquired measurement based on the state evolution model and the relative loss for false positives and accuracy, thus resulting in a time varying threshold policy. The paradigm was used in two applications: 1) detection of movement onset (behavioral state) from subthalamic single unit recordings in Parkinson's disease patients performing a motor task; 2) early detection of an approaching seizure (clinical state) from multichannel intracranial EEG recordings in rodents treated with pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant. Our paradigm performs significantly better than chance and improves over widely used detection algorithms.},

Here we investigate the performance of a multi-object adaptive optics system design for the European Extremely Large Telescope, using an end-to-end Monte-Carlo adaptive optics simulation tool, DASP, with relevance for proposed instruments such as MOSAIC. We consider parameters such as the number of laser guide stars, sodium layer depth, wavefront sensor pixel scale, actuator pitch and natural guide star availability. We provide potential areas where costs savings can be made, and investigate trade-offs between performance and cost, and provide solutions that would enable such an instrument to be built with currently available technology. Our key recommendations include a trade-off for laser guide star wavefront sensor pixel scale of about 0.7 arcseconds per pixel, and a field of view of at least 7 arcseconds, that EMCCD technology should be used for natural guide star wavefront sensors even if reduced frame rate is necessary, and that sky coverage can be improved by a slight reduction in natural guide star sub-aperture count without significantly affecting tomographic performance. We find that adaptive optics correction can be maintained across a wide field of view, up to 7 arcminutes in diameter. We also recommend the use of at least 4 laser guide stars, and include ground-layer and multi-object adaptive optics performance estimates.},

  abstract = {Sitosterolemia is a rare, autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter genes ABCG5 or ABCG8 that result in accumulation of xenosterols in the body. Clinical manifestations include tendon xanthomas, premature coronary artery disease, hemolytic anemia, macrothrombocytopenia, and bleeding. Although the effect of sterol accumulation on the predisposition for atherosclerosis is evident, how xenosterol accumulation leads to defects in platelet physiology is unknown. Sitosterolemia induced in Abcg5- and Abcg8-deficient mice fed a high plant sterol diet resulted in accumulation of free sterols in platelet plasma membranes, leading to hyperactivatable platelets characterized by constitutive binding of fibrinogen to its alpha IIb beta 3 integrin receptor, internalization of the alpha IIb beta 3 complex, generation of plateletderived microparticles, and changes in the quantity and subcellular localization of filamin. The latter was associated with macrothrombocytopenia, shedding of GPIb alpha, impaired platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor, and inability to form stable thrombi. Plasma levels of soluble GPIba were strongly correlated with plasma sitosterol levels in samples from human sitosterolemic patients, implicating a similar mechanism of sterol-induced platelet passivation in the human disease. Intercalation of plant sterols into the plasma membrane therefore results in dysregulation ofmultiple platelet activation pathways, leading tomacrothrombocytopenia and bleeding.},

High-speed, high resolution imaging can reveal dynamic events such as changes in blood flow and responses to stimulation. Despite these benefits, commercially available scientific cameras rarely include software that is suitable for in-vivo imaging applications, making this highly versatile form of optical imaging challenging and time-consuming to implement. To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences. The complete software suite is available for free download. Here we describe the software's framework and provide details to guide users with development of this and similar software.},

However, the non-determinism of the Petri Net model clashes with the imperative Turing- based environment provided by mainstream programming languages such as C/C++, Java and C\#. Therefore several design decisions must be taken in order to provide a concrete implementation of a Petri Net-based engine. This paper proposes the architecture of a workflow engine - currently implemented in a workflow management system (WfMS) - with the goal to provide a reliable and efficient platform for the execution of scientific workflows in a grid environment. One of the design principle is the neutrality towards the underlying mechanisms for task execution, in order not to compromise interoperability with multiple infrastructures.},

Theory of mind ability declined with increasing age, and the relationship between theory of mind and age was fully mediated by performance intelligence, executive function, and information processing speed and was partially mediated by verbal intelligence. Theory of mind performance correlated significantly with diffusion tensor imaging measures of white matter integrity but not with volume of white matter hyperintensities or whole-brain volume. Theory of mind age-related decline may not be independent of other cognitive functions; it may also be particularly susceptible to changes in white matter integrity.},

  abstract = {Summary Successful application of two-photon imaging with~genetic tools in awake macaque monkeys will enable fundamental advances in our understanding of higher cognitive function at the level of molecular and neuronal circuits. Here we report techniques for long-term two-photon imaging in awake macaque monkeys. Using genetically encoded indicators including GCaMP5 and GCaMP6s delivered by AAV2/1 into the visual cortex, we demonstrate that high-quality two-photon imaging of large neuronal populations can be achieved and maintained in awake monkeys for months. Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10~Hz to 150~Hz). By providing two-photon imaging access to cortical neuronal populations at single-cell or single dendritic spine resolution in awake monkeys, the techniques reported can help bridge the use of modern genetic and molecular tools and the study of higher cognitive function.},

Cardiac manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis are relatively infrequent, occurring within weeks after the infectious tick bite (median of 21\^A~days), and resulting at this stage from a direct borrelial infection of the myocardium, as indicated by reports of spirochete isolation from pericardium and myocardium. They may persist or appear in the late, tertiary phase of the illness, being then more likely due to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Lyme carditis typically presents with a fluctuating degree of atrioventricular block that spontaneously resolves in several days. Rarely, myocarditis may occur with or without pericardial involvement, in patients presenting with chest pain, ST depression or T wave inversion, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, and various arrhythmias are reported, as well as pericardial effusion or heart failure. A complete recovery is usually observed, spontaneous or after antibiotherapy. Severe myocarditis or Pericarditis leading to death is exceptional. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is based on the same association of clinical and laboratory features as in Lyme disease without cardiac involvement. But the occurrence of conduction disturbances in healthy young people suggests screening for other criteria of Lyme disease. The management of Lyme carditis does not differ from the treatment of Lyme disease without carditis and is mainly based upon the use of doxycycline or ceftriaxone.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018, International Association of Engineers. All rights reserved. One of the main challenges in the HPC clusters is the I/O bottleneck between the main memory (disk storage system) and the node memory. This bottleneck is a consequence of the fact that the disk access speed is thousands-fold slower than the processing speed of the parallel co-processors. We propose a strategy to reduce the impact of this bottleneck in a heterogeneous cluster. We use a seismic application as case study, in this application the I/O transfer operations could consume above 80\% of the overall processing time. The strategy puts forward a high-performance compression/decompression algorithm in terms of both compression ratio and processing time. The strategy is implemented in an FPGA-based cluster, which allowed us to implement a custom architecture. This architecture is optimized for both sequential and parallel stages of the decompression process. The proposed strategy can speed up the transfer operations up to 10\texttimes{} for a compression ratio of 16:1 and up to 3\texttimes{} for a compression ratio of 7:1. Therefore, our strategy effectively reduces the impact of the I/O bottleneck and can improve the cluster's overall performance.},

  abstract = {pbr/Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a blue-light-gated ion channel that can be used to stimulate genetically defined neurons reproducibly, rapidly and non-invasively. Existing approaches for delivering light to cells expressing ChR2 rely upon microscopes, lasers, arc lamps and shutters, all of which are relatively expensive and are not readily scalable for use on more than one brain region or animal at a time. In this paper, we describe an inexpensive method for delivering blue light locally and with millisecond precision to cells expressing ChR2. We accomplished this by coupling the light from a high-intensity blue light-emitting diode (LED; XLamp XR-E from CREE) into an optical fiber. When positioned in proximity to ChR2-expressing HEK293 cells, this fiber-coupled LED provided localized illumination of up to 32~mW/mm2 and generated ChR2 photocurrents as efficiently as wide-field mercury arc lamp illumination. This fiber-coupled LED was also used to photostimulate action potentials in ChR2-expressing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. LED light power and pulse frequency were controlled with an inexpensive, custom-built amplifier circuit. This scalable fiber-coupled LED system can be used to deliver light independent of the microscope objective and could, in principle, deliver light in parallel to multiple brain regions or to multiple genetically engineered animals./p},

  abstract = {RA is a common, relapsing autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints. Fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells are thought to be responsible for pannus formation and secretion of factors that recruit leucocytes to affected joints, thereby promoting bone and cartilage destruction. Fibrocytes are multipotent circulating stem cells that may have a role in RA pathogenesis, perhaps as the precursors of the FLS cells, or by regulating FLS cell function. We utilized multidimensional phospho-specific flow cytometry to characterize the activation status of peripheral blood (PB) fibrocytes derived from human RA patients at different stages of disease and from mice with CIA. Human PB fibrocytes from RA patients exhibited phosporylation activation of the p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases (MAPKs), and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and STAT-5 early in disease, within the first year of diagnosis. Similarly, in murine CIA, an increase in the total number of PB phosphoSTAT5-positive fibrocytes was observed at early time points in disease. Notably, in the affected paws of mice with CIA, we identified an increased number of fibrocytes, in contrast to the paws of control mice. These data suggest that activated fibrocytes may influence the disease process in RA and may serve as surrogate markers for disease in the PB of affected patients.},

  abstract = {Task-related hemodynamic responses contribute prominently to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high strong$\backslash$textit\{R\}\$\^\{$\backslash$textrm\{2\}\}\$/strong, the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.},

The former uses adaptive bifurcation to exploit the intrinsic chaotic dynamics arising from neuro-body-environment interactions, while the latter is based around proprioceptor adaptation. The architecture developed here allows realtime goal-directed exploration and learning of the possible motor patterns (e.g. for locomotion) of embodied systems of arbitrary morphology. Examples of its successful application to a simple biomechanical model and a simulated 3D swimming robot are given. The tractability of the biomechanical systems allows detailed analysis of the overall dynamics of the search process. This analysis points out strong parallels with evolutionary search.},

The logarithm of the capacity factor (k') decreased linearly with increasing concentration of urea. The use of a high concentration of urea allowed the MEKC separation of hydrophobic compounds, which were mostly included in the micelle and could not be resolved by conventional MEKC. The addition of urea also expanded the migration-time window and hence enhanced the resolution. The effect of urea is discussed from the standpoint of the contribution of urea to a diminished water structure around a hydrophobic solute. Two succesful examples of the application of the technique are given for the MEKC separation of a complex mixture and hydrophobic compounds. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

  issn = {00985589},
  doi = {10.1109/TSE.2002.1000452},
  abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that there is an optimal size for software components. This means that components that are too small or too big will have a higher defect content (i.e., there is a U-shaped curve relating defect content to size). The U-shaped curve has become known as the "Goldilocks Conjecture." Recently, a cognitive theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon and it has been expanded to characterize object-oriented software. This conjecture has wide implications for software engineering practice. It suggests 1) that designers should deliberately strive to design classes that are of the optimal size, 2) that program decomposition is harmful, and 3) that there exists a maximum (threshold) class size that should not be exceeded to ensure fewer faults in the software. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate this conjecture for object-oriented systems. We first demonstrate that the claims of an optimal component/class size (1) above) and of smaller components/classes having a greater defect content (2) above) are due to a mathematical artifact in the analyses performed previously. We then empirically test the threshold effect claims of this conjecture (3) above). To our knowledge, the empirical test of size threshold effects for object-oriented systems has not been performed thus far. We performed an initial study with an industrial C++ system and repeated it twice on another C++ system and on a commercial Java application. Our results provide unambiguous evidence that there is no threshold effect of class size. We obtained the same result for three systems using four different size measures. These findings suggest that there is a simple continuous relationship between class size and faults, and that, optimal class size, smaller classes are better and threshold effects conjectures have no sound theoretical nor empirical basis},

  abstract = {This paper presents two approaches for filter design based on stochastic distances for intensity speckle reduction. A window is defined around each pixel, overlapping samples are compared and only those which pass a goodness-of-fit test are used to compute the filtered value. The tests stem from stochastic divergences within the Information Theory framework. The technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with homogeneous regions using the Gamma model. The first approach uses a Nagao-Matsuyama-type procedure for setting the overlapping samples, and the second uses the nonlocal method. The proposals are compared with the Improved Sigma filter and with anisotropic diffusion for speckled data (SRAD) using a protocol based on Monte Carlo simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks, and line and edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal Image Quality Index and by the Pearson correlation between edges. Applications to real images are also discussed. The proposed methods show good results.},

  abstract = {We describe the design and performance of an electromechanical system for conducting multineuron recording experiments in alert non-human primates. The system is based on a simple design, consisting of a microdrive, control electronics, software, and a unique type of recording chamber. The microdrive consists of an aluminum frame, a set of eight linear actuators driven by computer-controlled miniature stepping motors, and two printed circuit boards (PCBs) that provide connectivity to the electrodes and the control electronics. The control circuitry is structured around an Atmel RISC-based microcontroller, which sends commands to as many as eight motor control cards, each capable of controlling eight motors. The microcontroller is programmed in C and uses serial communication to interface with a host computer. The graphical user interface for sending commands is written in C and runs on a conventional personal computer. The recording chamber is low in profile, mounts within a circular craniotomy, and incorporates a removable internal sleeve. A replaceable Sylastic membrane can be stretched across the bottom opening of the sleeve to provide a watertight seal between the cranial cavity and the external environment. This greatly reduces the susceptibility to infection, nearly eliminates the need for routine cleaning, and permits repeated introduction of electrodes into the brain at the same sites while maintaining the watertight seal. The system is reliable, easy to use, and has several advantages over other commercially available systems with similar capabilities.},

  abstract = {Background: Growing experimental evidence suggests an important role for cross-frequency coupling in neural processing, in particular for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Although the details of methods to detect PAC may vary, a common procedure to estimate the significance level is the comparison of observed values to those of at least 100 surrogate time series. When scanning large parts of the frequency spectrum and multiple recording sites, this could amount to very large computation times. New method: We demonstrate that the general linear model (GLM) allows for a parametric estimation of significant PAC. Continuous recordings are split into epochs, of a few seconds duration, on which an F-test can be performed. We compared its performance against traditional non-parametric permutation tests in both simulated and experimental data. Results: Our method was able to reproduce findings of phase-amplitude coupling in local field potential recordings obtained from the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson's disease. We also show that PAC may be detected between the subthalamic nucleus and cortical motor areas. Comparison with existing method(s): Although the GLM slightly underestimated significance compared to permutation tests in the simulations, for experimental data the two methods produced highly similar results. Computation times were drastically lower for the GLM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GLM can be easily extended by including additional predictors such as low-frequency amplitude to test for amplitude-amplitude coupling. Conclusions: The GLM forms an adequate and computationally efficient approach for detecting cross-frequency coupling with the flexibility to add other explanatory variables of interest.},

  shorttitle = {Ovulatory Cycle Effects on Tip Earnings by Lap Dan},
  abstract = {To see whether estrus was really ``lost'' during human evolution (as researchers often claim), we examined ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by professional lap dancers working in gentlemen's clubs. Eighteen dancers recorded their menstrual periods, work shifts, and tip earnings for 60 days on a study web site. A mixed-model analysis of 296 work shifts (representing about 5300 lap dances) showed an interaction between cycle phase and hormonal contraception use. Normally cycling participants earned about US\$335 per 5-h shift during estrus, US\$260 per shift during the luteal phase, and US\$185 per shift during menstruation. By contrast, participants using contraceptive pills showed no estrous earnings peak. These results constitute the first direct economic evidence for the existence and importance of estrus in contemporary human females, in a real-world work setting. These results have clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and economics.},

In particular, they can participate fully in fetal development when reintroduced into the embryo. The capacity for multilineage differentiation is reproduced in culture where embryonic stem cells can produce a wide range of well-defined cell types. This has stimulated interest in the isolation of analogous cells of human origin. Such human pluripotent stem cells could constitute a renewable source of more differentiated cells that could be employed to replace diseased or damaged tissue by cellular transplantation. In this review, the relationships between mouse embryonic stem cells, resident pluripotent cells in the embryo, and human embryo-derived cell lines are evaluated, and the prospects and challenges of embryo stem cell research are considered.},

  abstract = {Previous work has reported that it is not difficult to give people the illusion of ownership over an artificial body, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying body perception and self consciousness. We present an experimental study that uses immersive virtual reality (IVR) focused on identifying the perceptual building blocks of this illusion. We systematically manipulated visuotactile and visual sensorimotor contingencies, visual perspective, and the appearance of the virtual body in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological measures showed that a first person perspective over a fake humanoid body is essential for eliciting a body ownership illusion. We found that the illusion of ownership can be generated when the virtual body has a realistic skin tone and spatially substitutes the real body seen from a first person perspective. In this case there is no need for an additional contribution of congruent visuotactile or sensorimotor cues. Additionally, we found that the processing of incongruent perceptual cues can be modulated by the level of the illusion: when the illusion is strong, incongruent cues are not experienced as incorrect. Participants exposed to asynchronous visuotactile stimulation can experience the ownership illusion and perceive touch as originating from an object seen to contact the virtual body. Analogously, when the level of realism of the virtual body is not high enough and/or when there is no spatial overlap between the two bodies, then the contribution of congruent multisensory and/or sensorimotor cues is required for evoking the illusion. On the basis of these results and inspired by findings from neurophysiological recordings in the monkey, we propose a model that accounts for many of the results reported in the literature.},

Novel voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins allow for direct measurement of neuron membrane potential changes through changes in fluorescence. Here, we utilized ArcLight, a recently developed GEVI, and examined the functional characteristics in the widely used mouse somatosensory whisker pathway. We measured the resulting evoked fluorescence using a wide-field microscope and a CCD camera at 200 Hz, which enabled voltage recordings over the entire cortical region with high temporal resolution. We found that ArcLight produced a fluorescent response in the S1 barrel cortex during sensory stimulation at single whisker resolution. During wide-field cortical imaging, we encountered substantial hemodynamic noise that required additional post hoc processing through noise subtraction techniques. Over a period of 28 days, we found clear and consistent ArcLight fluorescence responses to a simple sensory input. Finally, we demonstrated the use of ArcLight to resolve cortical S1 sensory responses in the awake mouse. Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of ArcLight as a measurement tool for mesoscopic, chronic imaging.},

To this end we design a method, based on intersecting epipolar constraints, for providing ground truth correspondence automatically. These correspondences are based purely on geometric information, and do not rely on the choice of a specific feature appearance descriptor. We test detector-descriptor combinations on a database of 100 objects viewed from 144 calibrated viewpoints under three different lighting conditions. We find that the combination of Hessian-affine feature finder and SIFT features is most robust to viewpoint change. Harris-affine combined with SIFT and Hessian-affine combined with shape context descriptors were best respectively for lighting change and change in camera focal length. We also find that no detector-descriptor combination performs well with viewpoint changes of more than 25--30$\circ$.},

The research involved reviewing the case notes of a representative sample of children/young people in care during the 2015/16 financial year. The research also applied a broad definition of harm. These innovative methodological improvements were designed to provide a more accurate and complete understanding of safety in care. The research found that 85 children/young people in care experienced an incident of harm during the 2015/16 financial year, out of the total sample of 698. As a representative sample, this overall extent of harm can be extrapolated across the full population of children/young people in care during 2015/16. Due to methodological improvements, the extent of harm identified within this research is higher than in historically reported rates. The research found that the number of M\=aori experiencing harm was higher than non-M\=aori, and that most children/young people were five years and older at the time harm was perpetrated. The research also found variation in the types, perpetrators and context of harm, and that children/young people's experience of harm differed across placements. Due to the sampling approach used and the nature of the research, these findings only relate to the 85 children/young people identified as experiencing an incident of harm and cannot be extrapolated to the full 2015/16 care population.

To date, the preferred approach to this task largely relies on electrode array implants. We are currently pursuing two alternative methods for light-based direct activation of the RGCs. The first method is based on applying caged glutamate over the retina and uncaging it locally to obtain RGC excitation. The second method is to artificially cause RGCs to express Channelrhodopsin II (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. In addition to being non-contact, optical techniques lend themselves relatively easily to a variety of technologies for achieving patterned stimulation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP - DMD) technology, we have developed an optical stimulation system capable of controlled, large-scale, flexible stimulation of the retinal tissue with high temporal accuracy. In preliminary studies, we are performing patterned photo-stimulation experiments using samples of caged fluorescent probes and in rat retinas that were virally transfected with ChR2.},

This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

Despite an increasingly large number of invertebrate and rodent studies showing profound electrophysiological and behavioral effects induced by optogenetics [1, 2], only two primate studies have reported modulation of local single-cell activity but with no behavioral effects [3, 4]. Here, we show that optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons within rhesus monkey arcuate sulcus, during the execution of a visually guided saccade task, evoked significant and reproducible changes in saccade latencies as a function of target position. Moreover, using concurrent optogenetic stimulation and opto-fMRI [5, 6]), we observed optogenetically induced changes in fMRI activity in specific functional cortical networks throughout the monkey brain. This is critical information for the advancement of optogenetic primate research models and for initiating the development of optogenetically based cell-specific therapies with which to treat neurological diseases in humans.},

  abstract = {Artifact rejection is a central issue when dealing with electroencephalogram recordings. Although independent component analysis (ICA) separates data in linearly independent components (IC), the classification of these components as artifact or EEG signal still requires visual inspection by experts.In this paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of feature vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing algorithms.We compare the performance of this automated classifier to visual classification by experts and identify range filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential for automated IC artifact recognition (accuracy rate 88\%). We obtain almost the same level of recognition performance for geometric features and local binary pattern (LBP) features.Compared to the existing automated solutions the proposed method has two main advantages: First, it does not depend on direct recording of artifact signals, which then, e.g. have to be subtracted from the contaminated EEG. Second, it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact.In summary, the present method is an automatic, reliable, real-time capable and practical tool that reduces the time intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact removal. The results are very promising despite the relatively small channel resolution of 25 electrodes.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.061},
  shorttitle = {Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement},
  abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z  4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

  abstract = {N euroscience is transforming. Brain data collected in multitudes of individuals and institutions around the world are being openly shared, moved from office desks and personal storage devices to institutionally supported cloud systems and public repositories\textemdash{}effectively bringing Neuroscience into the era of Big Data. This is an important evolution in Neuroscience, since the value of open data sharing has not always been recognized 1\textendash{}5 . Indeed, the value of neuroscience data sharing was highlighted in a recent Special Focus issue in Nature Neuroscience 6 . As a leading example of this trend, this month Scientific Data is launching a collection of articles presenting diverse brain imaging data sets, which collectively provide valuable resources for validation and reproduction of neuroscience findings based on human magnetic resonance imaging (hMRI). hMRI stands out from the neuroscientific crowd because standards have begun to be established for hardware, file formats (for example, see DICOM, http://dicom.nema.org/ and NIfTI, http://nifti.nimh. nih.gov/) and acquisition protocols 7\textendash{}9 . Many hopes are also being put on large-scale processing of big neuroimaging data and the potential impact it will have on understanding the human brain. But, while there is clear value in data standardization, there is also value in collecting and sharing heterogeneous datasets generated from a variety of hardware and acquisition protocols. This is precisely the strength of the datasets published within the Scientific Data MRI Reproducibility Collection. The datasets in the Collection provide unique hMRI measurements collected using different modalities, including both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging as well as associated physiological and behavioral data. Central to this Collection are data aggregated and released by the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), which has grown out of the established 1000 Functional Connectomes Project 10 . The CoRR measurements were repeated at least twice providing the foundations for test-retest reliability estimates that can be used in combination with modern statistical methods to validate and reproduce scientific results. The manuscript by Zuo et al. 11 provides an overview of the CoRR project, and describes data collected by 36 research groups in 18 institutions and three continents (America, Asia and Europe). Also in association with CoRR, Gorgolewski et al. 12 report functional imaging data acquired with spatial resolutions higher than current standards (1.5 and 0.75 mm 3). Data were collected repeatedly in the same individuals and accompanied by physiological measurements (such as subjects' respiration and heartbeat) and cognitive and affective measures. Overall, the large sample size, rich diversity and the repeated measurements across the CoRR datasets provide the multiplicity and scale necessary for building, evaluating and testing models of human brain functional connectivity. Also included in the launch of this Collection, Maclaren et al. 13 collected human brain anatomy data using the standard protocol established by the Alzheimers' Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 14 . Importantly, data acquisition was repeated multiple times in each individual brain providing first hand resources for test-retest reliability estimates on the protocol. Additional articles describing valuable brain imaging datasets will be added to this Collection in a rolling manner.},

O84E.pdf Jun.15,2016 High Performance Supercapacitor (EDLC) DMT Series: General Purpose Type \~Wide operation temperature range \& High reliability for various applications\~ Features Applications and Benefits c High operational temperature up to 85$^\circ$C c High power: Discharge up to 10A max. per device c High power density / Small and slim package Optimum for portable devices or devices with limited space c High energy / Flexible charge-discharge Higher power is available by connecting several supercapacitors in series or parallel. c Low leakage current 5$\mathrm{\mu}$A@96hrs. c Long cycle life c High reliability Characteristic degradation is reduced by excellent package sealing and optimized electrochemical system. DMT series can be used at 70$^\circ$C for five years. To meet consumer demand for mobile devices with greater efficiency and functionality, Murata began focusing its R\&D efforts on supercapacitors (EDLC: Electrical Double Layer Capacitors) in 2008, at which time we made a strategic decision to license leading-edge supercapacitor technology from CAP-XX () an Australia-based firm. Working from this collaborative basis, Murata has enhanced the design and manufacturer of these high power (low ESR) supercapacitors in a compact, slim package, and we continue our research efforts to develop even better and higher performing products. Supercapacitors, are energy storage devices with high power density characteristics that are up to 1,000 times greater than what is typically found in conventional capacitor technology. Murata's supercapacitor combines these advanced characteristics in a small and slim module. Optimization of electrochemical systems, including the electrode structure, enables flexible charging and discharging from high to low output over a range of temperatures. Load},

Whereas the wide variety of involuntary behaviors (and here mostly the deviant or pathological ones will be considered) will necessarily be represented at some biophysical level in nervous system activity\textendash{}for after all those cellular activity patterns manifest themselves as behaviors and thus there will be a multiplicity of them\textendash{}there could be some general tendencies to be discerned amongst that assortment. Collecting observations derived from neurophysiological activity associated with several pathological conditions characterized by presenting will-less actions such as Parkinson's disease, seizures, alien hand syndrome and tics, it is proposed that a general neurophysiologic tendency of brain activity that correlates with involuntary actions is higher than normal synchrony in specific brain cell networks, depending upon the behavior in question. Wilful, considered normal behavior, depends on precise coordination of the collective activity in cell ensembles that may be lost, or diminished, when there are tendencies toward more than normal or aberrant synchronization of cellular activity. Hence, rapid fluctuations in synchrony is associated with normal actions and cognition while less variability in brain recordings particularly with regards to synchronization could be a signature of unconscious and deviant behaviors in general.},

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

  abstract = {In a prior study on electronic cigarette (EC) refill fluids, Cinnamon Ceylon was the most cytotoxic of 36 products tested. The purpose of the current study was to determine if high cytotoxicity is a general feature of cinnamon-flavored EC refill fluids and to identify the toxicant(s) in Cinnamon Ceylon. Eight cinnamon-flavored refill fluids, which were screened using the MTT assay, varied in their cytotoxicity with most being cytotoxic. Human embryonic stem cells were generally more sensitive than human adult pulmonary fibroblasts. Most products were highly volatile and produced vapors that impaired survival of cells in adjacent wells. Cinnamaldehyde (CAD), 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2MOCA), dipropylene glycol, and vanillin were identified in the cinnamon-flavored refill fluids using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). When authentic standards of each chemical were tested using the MTT assay, only CAD and 2MOCA were highly cytotoxic. The amount of each chemical in the refill fluids was quantified using HPLC, and cytotoxicity correlated with the amount of CAD/product. Duplicate bottles of the same product were similar, but varied in their concentrations of 2MOCA. These data show that the cinnamon flavorings in refill fluids are linked to cytotoxicity, which could adversely affect EC users. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the architectural alterations of the lateral ankle ligaments in spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. METHODS: Eight children (5 male and 3 female; mean age +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 2.7 years) with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy were recruited. A modified Ashworth scale and passive ankle dorsiflexion angle were evaluated. Sonograms of the anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament were obtained to measure ligament thickness, and the anterior talofibular/calcaneofibular ligament thickness ratio was calculated. Two sonographic measurements were taken to check for intra-rater reliability. RESULTS: The interclass correlation coefficients of the repeated anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament thickness measurements in the unaffected/affected legs were 0.960/0.945 and 0.922/0.933, respectively. The anterior talofibular ligament thickness in the affected legs was significantly greater than that in the unaffected legs (2.50 +/- 0.35 versus 1.40 +/- 0.28 mm; P = .011), but the calcaneofibular ligament thickness in the affected legs was significantly less than that in the unaffected legs (0.80 +/- 0.18 versus 1.28 +/- 0.31 mm; P = .021). The anterior talofibular/calcaneofibular ligament thickness ratio in the affected legs was significantly greater than that in unaffected legs (2.10 +/- 0.81 versus 1.03 +/- 0.13; P = .012). The ratio was positively correlated with the modified Ashworth scale and age but negatively correlated with the passive ankle dorsiflexion angle in the affected legs. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an increased anterior talofibular ligament thickness and a decreased calcaneofibular ligament thickness in the affected legs compared with the unaffected legs. These architectural features of the lateral ankle ligaments may contribute to the equinovarus deformity of the ankle together with spastic leg muscles in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with three-dimensional (3-D) fiber tractography can visualize traumatic axonal shearing injury that results in posterior callosal disconnection syndrome. METHODS: A 22-year-old man underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging 3 days and 12 weeks after blunt head injury. The magnetic resonance images included whole-brain DTI acquired with a single-shot spin echo echoplanar sequence. 3-D DTI fiber tractography of the splenium of the corpus callosum was performed. Quantitative DTI parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy, from the site of splenial injury were compared with those of a normal adult male volunteer. RESULTS: Conventional magnetic resonance images revealed findings of diffuse axonal injury, including a lesion at the midline of the splenium of the corpus callosum. DTI performed 3 days posttrauma revealed that the splenial lesion had reduced apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy, reflecting a large decrease in the magnitude of diffusion parallel to the white matter fibers, which had partially recovered as revealed by follow-up DTI 12 weeks postinjury. 3-D tractography revealed an interruption of the white matter fibers in the posteroinferior aspect of the splenium that correlated with the patient's left hemialexia, a functional deficit caused by disconnection of the right visual cortex from the language centers of the dominant left hemisphere. CONCLUSION: DTI with 3-D fiber tractography can visualize acute axonal shearing injury, which may have prognostic value for the cognitive and neurological sequelae of traumatic brain injury.},

An optical analysis demonstrated that NIR radiation is a negligible source of heating in this case. LED heat conduction however is a major source of heating, and LEDs, though much safer than laser diodes, have been known to cause burns if improperly used. We describe a procedure by which we measure the heat conduction effect of LEDs.

  abstract = {The quest to determine how precise neural activity patterns mediate computation, behavior, and pathology would be greatly aided by a set of tools for reliably activating and inactivating genetically targeted neurons, in a temporally precise and rapidly reversible fashion. Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven ChR2, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The Halo/ChR2 system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells.},

However, there is no previous study on how the measure should be used: which compressor and image format are the most suitable. This paper presents a practical study of the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) applied to color images. The questions we try to answer are: Is NCD a suitable metric for image comparison? How robust is it to rotation, translation, and scaling? Which are the most adequate image formats and compression algorithms? The results of our study show that NCD can be used to address some of the selected image comparison problems, but care must be taken on the compressor and image format selected.},

Furthermore, imaging of blood flow during stroke is not routinely done. We take advantage of in vivo bihemispheric transcranial windows for longitudinal mesoscopic imaging of cortical function to establish a protocol for focal ischemic stroke induction in target brain regions using photothrombosis in awake head-fixed mice. Our protocol does not require any surgical steps at the time of stroke induction or anesthetics during either head fixation or photoactivation. In addition, we performed laser speckle contrast imaging and wide-field calcium imaging to reveal the effect of cortical spreading ischemic depolarization after stroke in both anesthetized and awake animals over a spatial scale encompassing both hemispheres. With our combined approach, we observed ischemic depolarizing waves (3 to [Formula: see text]) propagating across the cortex 1 to 5 min after stroke induction in genetically encoded calcium indicator mice. Measures of blood flow by laser speckle were correlated with neurological impairment and lesion volume, suggesting a metric for reducing experimental variability. The ability to follow brain dynamics immediately after stroke as well as during recovery may provide a valuable guide to develop activity-dependent therapeutic interventions to be performed shortly after stroke induction.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the baseline optical properties of the tissues of the human head is essential for absolute cerebral oximetry, and for quantitative studies of brain activation. In this work we numerically model the utility of signals from a small 6-optode time-resolved diffuse optical tomographic apparatus for inferring baseline scattering and absorption coefficients of the scalp, skull and brain, when complete geometric information is available from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use an optical model where MRI-segmented tissues are assumed homogeneous. We introduce a noise model capturing both photon shot noise and forward model numerical accuracy, and use Bayesian inference to predict errorbars and correlations on the measurments. We also sample from the full posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We conclude that \~ 106 detected photons are sufficient to measure the brain's scattering and absorption to a few percent. We present preliminary results using a fast multi-layer slab model, comparing the case when layer thicknesses are known versus unknown.},

  abstract = {Hybrid voltage sensors (hVoS) probe membrane potential by coupling the fluorescence of membrane-anchored proteins to the movement of a membrane-embedded hydrophobic anion dipicrylamine. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between these two components transduces voltage changes into fluorescence changes, providing a signal for imaging electrical activity in genetically targeted cells. To improve hVoS signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting motifs, and linkages of fluorescent proteins to optimize the normalized fluorescence change ($\Delta$F/F) and signal/noise ratio. The best results were obtained with cerulean fluorescent protein tagged N-terminally with a GAP43 motif and C-terminally with a truncated h-ras motif. With 100 mV steps in PC12 cells, this probe produced $\Delta$F/F = 26\% (4 $\mu$M dipicrylamine), which was threefold greater than that obtained with the original farnesylated EGFP construct. We also obtained a fivefold greater signal/noise ratio, which was 70\% of a theoretical optimum. We designate this GAP43-CerFP-t-h-ras construct as hVoS 2.0. With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that hVoS 2.0 places its fluorophore $\sim$40 \AA{} from the bilayer midplane. hVoS 2.0 performed well in cultured hippocampal neurons, where single action potentials produced clear fluorescence changes in a single trial. This improved probe should help investigators image voltage in genetically targeted neurons. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has made major progress in recent years thanks to a technique known as deep learning, which works by mimicking the human brain. When computers employ deep learning, they learn by using networks made up of many layers of simulated neurons. Deep learning has opened the door to computers with human \textendash{} or even super-human \textendash{} levels of skill in recognizing images, processing speech and controlling vehicles. But many neuroscientists are skeptical about whether the brain itself performs deep learning. The patterns of activity that occur in computer networks during deep learning resemble those seen in human brains. But some features of deep learning seem incompatible with how the brain works. Moreover, neurons in artificial networks are much simpler than our own neurons. For instance, in the region of the brain responsible for thinking and planning, most neurons have complex tree-like shapes. Each cell has `roots' deep inside the brain and `branches' close to the surface. By contrast, simulated neurons have a uniform structure. To find out whether networks made up of more realistic simulated neurons could be used to make deep learning more biologically realistic, Guerguiev et al. designed artificial neurons with two compartments, similar to the `roots' and `branches'. The network learned to recognize hand-written digits more easily when it had many layers than when it had only a few. This shows that artificial neurons more like those in the brain can enable deep learning. It even suggests that our own neurons may have evolved their shape to support this process. If confirmed, the link between neuronal shape and deep learning could help us develop better brain-computer interfaces. These allow people to use their brain activity to control devices such as artificial limbs. Despite advances in computing, we are still superior to computers when it comes to learning. Understanding how our own brains show deep learning could thus help us develop better, more human-like artificial intelligence in the future.},

However, functionality of optogenetic tools has not been fully explored outside neuroscience; and a non-viral, non-embryogenesis based strategy for optogenetics has not been shown before. Methods and Results\textemdash{}We demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit (TCU) strategy, where non-excitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically-excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expressing cell line was developed, characterized and used as a cell delivery system. The TCU strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electrical waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically-triggered waves. Conclusions\textemdash{}Our results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light using the TCU approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control, remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research, but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators. The TCU strategy is extendable to (non-viral) stem cell therapy and is directly relevant to in vivo applications.},

Chlamydospores were disconnected from pseudomycelial cells either enzymatically using beta-glucuronidase or mechanically by ultrasonic treatment. Free chlamydospores were separated from other cell material by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The resulting preparations were inspected by light-microscopy and electron-microscopy. Both methods yielded preparations with a level of over 90\% chlamydospore cells. Ultrasonic treatment caused little change to the ultrastructure of the chlamydospores, whereas the enzyme treatment profoundly affected the cell wall. It is concluded that ultrasonic treatment is an efficient method for obtaining pure preparations of chlamydospores.},

Brain\textendash{}computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or \{$\backslash$textasciitilde\}15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

  abstract = {Neural stimulation with high spatial and temporal precision is desirable both for studying the real-time dynamics of neural networks and for prospective clinical treatment of neurological diseases. Optical stimulation of genetically targeted neurons expressing the light sensitive channel protein Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) has recently been reported as a means for millisecond temporal control of neuronal spiking activities with cell-type selectivity. This offers the prospect of enabling local delivery of optical stimulation and the simultaneous monitoring of the neural activity by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We report here a novel dual-modality hybrid device, which consists of a tapered coaxial optical waveguide ('optrode') integrated into a 100 element intra-cortical multi-electrode recording array. We first demonstrate the dual optical delivery and electrical recording capability of the single optrode in in vitro preparations of mouse retina, photo-stimulating the native retinal photoreceptors while recording light-responsive activities from ganglion cells. The dual-modality array device was then used in ChR2 transfected mouse brain slices. Specifically, epileptiform events were reliably optically triggered by the optrode and their spatiotemporal patterns were simultaneously recorded by the multi-electrode array.},

The light propagation is modeled with the radiative-transfer equation in the vicinity of the laser sources, and the diffusion approximation is used elsewhere in the domain. The solution of the radiative-transfer equation is used to construct a Dirichlet boundary condition for the diffusion approximation on a fictitious interface within the object. This boundary condition constitutes an approximative distributed source model for the diffusion approximation in the remaining area. The results from the proposed approach are compared with finite-element solutions of the radiative-transfer equation and the diffusion approximation and Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the method improves the accuracy of the forward model compared with the conventional diffusion model.},

  abstract = {Becoming aware of errors that one has committed might be crucial for strategic behavioral and neuronal adjustments to avoid similar errors in the future. This review addresses conscious error perception (``error awareness'') in healthy subjects as well as the relationship between error awareness and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We first discuss the main findings on error awareness in healthy subjects. A brain region, that appears consistently involved in error awareness processes, is the insula, which also provides a link to the clinical conditions reviewed here. Then we focus on a neurological condition whose core element is an impaired awareness for neurological consequences of a disease: anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). The insular cortex has been implicated in both error awareness and AHP, with anterior insular regions being involved in conscious error processing and more posterior areas being related to AHP. In addition to cytoarchitectonic and connectivity data, this reflects a functional and structural gradient within the insula from anterior to posterior. Furthermore, studies dealing with error awareness and lack of insight in a number of psychiatric diseases are reported. Especially in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) the performance monitoring system seems impaired, thus conscious error perception might be altered.},

  abstract = {In the mammalian nervous system, billions of neurons connected by quadrillions of synapses exchange electrical, chemical and mechanical signals. Disruptions to this network manifest as neurological or psychiatric conditions. Despite decades of neuroscience research, our ability to treat or even to understand these conditions is limited by the capability of tools to probe the signalling complexity of the nervous system. Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not recapitulate the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation. Advances in genetic tools for manipulating neural activity have fuelled the demand for devices that are capable of simultaneously recording and controlling individual neurons at unprecedented scales. Recently, flexible organic electronics and bio- and nanomaterials have been developed for multifunctional and minimally invasive probes for long-term interaction with the nervous system. In this Review, we discuss the design lessons from the quarter-century-old field of neural engineering, highlight recent materials-driven progress in neural probes and look at emergent directions inspired by the principles of neural transduction.},

However, formal information theoretic definitions until very recently were only available for information transfer and storage, not for modification. This has changed with the extension of Shannon information theory via the decomposition of the mutual information between inputs to and the output of a process into unique, shared and synergistic contributions from the inputs, called a partial information decomposition (PID). The synergistic contribution in particular has been identified as the basis for a definition of information modification. We here review the requirements for a functional definition of information modification in neuroscience, and apply a recently proposed measure of information modification to investigate the developmental trajectory of information modification in a culture of neurons vitro, using partial information decomposition. We found that modification rose with maturation, but ultimately collapsed when redundant information among neurons took over. This indicates that this particular developing neural system initially developed intricate processing capabilities, but ultimately displayed information processing that was highly similar across neurons, possibly due to a lack of external inputs. We close by pointing out the enormous promise PID and the analysis of information modification hold for the understanding of neural systems.},

Halide programmers need only provide a high-level strategy for map-ping an image processing pipeline to a parallel machine (a schedule), and the Halide compiler carries out the mechanical task of generating platform-specific code that implements the schedule. Unfortunately, designing high-performance schedules for complex image process-ing pipelines requires substantial knowledge of modern hardware architecture and code-optimization techniques. In this paper we provide an algorithm for automatically generating high-performance schedules for Halide programs. Our solution extends the function bounds analysis already present in the Halide compiler to automat-ically perform locality and parallelism-enhancing global program transformations typical of those employed by expert Halide develop-ers. The algorithm does not require costly (and often impractical) auto-tuning, and, in seconds, generates schedules for a broad set of image processing benchmarks that are performance-competitive with, and often better than, schedules manually authored by expert Halide developers on server and mobile CPUs, as well as GPUs.},

Misra and Gries introduced their seminal algorithm for the problem in 1982, and the problem has since been revisited many times due its practicality and applicability. We describe a highly optimized version of Misra and Gries' algorithm that is suitable for deployment in industrial settings. Our code is made public via an open source library called DataSketches that is already used by several companies and production systems. Our algorithm improves on two theoretical and practical aspects of prior work. First, it handles weighted updates in amortized constant time, a common requirement in practice. Second, it uses a simple and fast method for merging summaries that asymptotically improves on prior work even for unweighted streams. We describe experiments confirming that our algorithms are more efficient than prior proposals.},

  abstract = {Technologies for silencing the electrical activity of genetically-targeted neurons in the brain are important for assessing the contribution of specific cell types and pathways towards behaviors and pathologies. Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain \{TP\}009, which we named \{ArchT\}, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (\{$\backslash$textasciitilde\}900 \{pA\}), but with a 3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, equating to 2x increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber (notably, in the typical optogenetic range of 1-10 \{mW\}/mm2). Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, \{ArchT\} expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore \{ArchT\} function in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of \{ArchT\}-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (\{$\backslash$textasciitilde\}100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/sec upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that \{ArchT\} silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Background: Infrared (IR) technology is a flexible and effective way of measuring animal locomotion. However, the cost of most commercial IR equipment can limit their availability. We have designed an inexpensive and effective replacement for commercial IR sensors that can be attached to enclosures to monitor animal locomotion. New method: IR components were soldered to circuits connected to a single microcontroller. These IR components were housed inexpensively using plastic tubing and cork discs to further focus and extend detection of the IR beam. A standard personal computer recorded data from circuit boards connected to an inexpensive interface. This system may be used in a range of lighting conditions without requiring readjustment or recalibration. Results: Validation of our equipment design was done with male Sprague Dawley rats treated with reserpine 22. h prior to administration of saline or l-DOPA (125. mg/kg). Data was collected in eight different measures: horizontal activity, immobile time, elevated activity, centre elevated activity, elevation time, elevation bout, and repeated and non-repeated movement while elevated. l-DOPA increased horizontal movement and all elevated activity excepting elevated movement and centre elevated movement, demonstrating selective drug effects. Comparison with existing methods: The total cost of our complete IR system (US\$517.45) was substantially less than the least expensive quote (US\$19,666.90) obtained for a commercial IR system. Conclusions: We have successfully designed and constructed a flexible and inexpensive IR system to monitor at least eight measures of rodent locomotion at a significantly lesser cost than quoted by commercial suppliers.},

Tools can be made to flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage. This approach requires an interface layer between tools and mapping services.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present BridgeDb, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping. This framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations. BridgeDb provides its own ready-to-go mapping services, both in webservice and local database forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and adaptation to any identifier mapping service. BridgeDb has already been integrated into several bioinformatics applications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All described software is open source and available at http://www.bridgedb.org.},

Its surface and shores are 423 metres (1,388 ft) below sea level,[3] Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is 377 m (1,237 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 33.7\% salinity, it is also one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazk\"ol and some hypersaline lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond) have reported higher salinities. It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean.[5] This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is 55 kilometres (34 mi) long and 18 kilometres (11 mi) wide at its widest point.[1] It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.},

Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

  abstract = {Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that control the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials (APs). Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Malfunction of an ion channel's sensing or gating module can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation of the nervous system with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders.},

  title = {History-Dependent Variability in Population Dynamics during Evidence Accumulation in Cortex},
  volume = {19},
  issn = {15461726},
  doi = {10.1038/nn.4403},
  abstract = {We studied how cortical circuits combine new information with ongoing activity dynamics as mice accumulated visual evidence for decision-making in a virtual-navigation task. As single trials unfolded, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) transitioned rapidly between distinguishable activity patterns made up of mostly different sets of active neurons. Using new methods to analyze population activity dynamics, we found that each event in a trial \textemdash{} whether an evidence cue or a behavioral choice \textemdash{} caused seconds-long modifications to the probabilities that govern how one activity pattern transitions to the next, forming a short-term memory. A sequence of evidence cues triggered a chain of these modifications from which a signal for accumulated evidence emerged. Multiple distinguishable activity patterns were possible for the same level of accumulated evidence because representations of ongoing events were influenced by the sequence of previous within and across trial events. Our results indicate that evidence accumulation need not require the explicit competition between groups of neurons, as in winner-take-all models. Instead, we propose evidence accumulation emerges implicitly from general dynamical properties of the PPC that instantiate short-term memory. 2 Introduction The activity patterns in a cortical microcircuit are determined both by the characteristics of the external inputs it receives and the dynamic, ongoing changes in its internal activity state. Combining ongoing activity with new inputs is essential for many complex neural computations, including evidence accumulation during decision-making. Much work has focused on identifying the neuronal algorithms and mechanisms by which evidence accumulation occurs 1,2 . Considerable focus has been placed on the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) 3-7 , which is thought to be necessary for the accumulation of visual evidence in rodents 8 . Previous work has emphasized a conceptual model in which evidence accumulation occurs as a winner-take-all competition between neuronal activity patterns associated with different decisions 2,9 . This view predicts that as evidence is accumulated, activity converges to one of several attractor states, with each possible decision associated with a different attractor. Winner-take-all dynamics have commonly been implemented as a highly structured competition between distinct recurrently connected pools of neurons with mutual inhibition across pools 10-12 . These features lead to long-lasting firing rate changes in individual neurons that are homogeneous within a pool. Although this implementation is supported by some experimental data 3-7,13 , recent work showing the prevalence of time-varying activity patterns in neuronal populations 14-18 provides initial suggestions of potential alternatives. For example, alternate implementations of winner-take-all competitions could also be possible, such as competitions between sequences of population activity. Or, entirely different algorithms for evidence accumulation might be present that do not require winner-take-all mechanisms. The study of evidence accumulation has in part been restricted in two important ways. First, the experimental methods available to study neuronal activity during evidence accumulation have been limited. Previous work has in large part emphasized independent recordings from selected subsets of individual neurons, typically summarized as averages across trials and cells. However, because animals make decisions on single trials, the study of neuronal population activity dynamics on a moment-by-moment basis could be essential for uncovering the key underlying neuronal mechanisms. Second, models proposing mechanisms other than winner-take-all competitions have not emerged, such that much recent work has focused on examining possible implementations of winner-take-all models instead of testing the overarching algorithms for evidence accumulation.},

It is often thought to be a largely intractable problem in adult patients because of a lack of neuronal plasticity after this critical period [1]; however, recent advances have suggested that plasticity is still present in the adult amblyopic visual cortex [2-6]. Here, we present data showing that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the visual cortex can temporarily improve contrast sensitivity in the amblyopic visual cortex. The results indicate continued plasticity of the amblyopic visual system in adulthood and open the way for a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of amblyopia.},

These stresses are examined and discussed in relation to previous clinical, laboratory, and histological studies.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash{}After the recent cloning of light-sensitive ion channels and their expression in mammalian cells, a new field, optogenetics, emerged in neuroscience, allowing for precise perturbations of neural circuits by light. However, functionality of optogenetic tools has not been fully explored outside neuroscience; and a non-viral, non-embryogenesis based strategy for optogenetics has not been shown before. Methods and Results\textemdash{}We demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit (TCU) strategy, where non-excitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically-excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expressing cell line was developed, characterized and used as a cell delivery system. The TCU strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electrical waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically-triggered waves. Conclusions\textemdash{}Our results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light using the TCU approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control, remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research, but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators. The TCU strategy is extendable to (non-viral) stem cell therapy and is directly relevant to in vivo applications.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the usefulness of the normalized compression distance (NCD) for image similarity detection. Instead of the direct NCD between images, the paper considers the correlation between NCD based feature vectors extracted for each image. The vectors are derived by computing the NCD between the original image and sequences of translated (rotated) versions. Feature vectors for simple transforms (circular translations on horizontal, vertical, diagonal directions and rotations around image center) and several standard compressors are generated and tested in a very simple experiment of similarity detection between the original image and two filtered versions (median and moving average). The promising vector configurations (geometric transform, lossless compressor) are further tested for similarity detection on the 24 images of the Kodak set subject to some common image processing. While the direct computation of NCD fails to detect image similarity even in the case of simple median and moving average filtering in 3 \texttimes{} 3 windows, for certain transforms and compressors, the proposed approach appears to provide robustness at similarity detection against smoothing, lossy compression, contrast enhancement, noise addition and some robustness against geometrical transforms (scaling, cropping and rotation).},

  abstract = {The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the observer and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically focus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a purely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method. The resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

The mechanism by which they acquire their exquisite temperature sensitivity is unknown and is currently an area of intense research. For this reason, there is a need for diverse methods to deliver controlled temperature stimuli. New method: We have developed a simple, inexpensive and reliable method to deliver temperature pulses to small volumes surrounding the recording area, which can be either a patch-clamp pipette containing a cell-free membrane with thermally activated channels or a whole cell attached to a pipette. Results: Here we developed a micro-heater based on resistive heating of a copper filament enclosed in a glass capillary that is capable of delivering fast and localized temperature changes. We validated the performance of the micro-heaters by analyzing the heat-induced activation of TRPV1 thermoTRP channels recorded in inside-out patches and demonstrate the use of the micro-heaters. Comparison with existing method(s): The micro-heaters we introduce here are compact, easy to fabricate and to operate. In contrast with bulk solution heaters commercially available, our method is extremely affordable and simple to operate. To the best of our knowledge there are no other similar, commercially available heating methods. Conclusions: The micro-heater method is simple and should provide a straightforward and rapid experimental tool to study mechanisms in thermally activated ion channels.},

To this date, very few studies have tried to integrate third-person data, or data about the neurophysiological correlates of conscious states, with first-person data, or data about subjective experience. Inspired by Morel's invention (Casares, 1940), a literary machine capable of reproducing sensory-dependent external reality, this article suggests that combination of virtual reality techniques and brain reading technologies, that is, decoding of conscious states by brain activity alone, can offer this integration. It is also proposed that the multimodal, simulating, and integrative capacities of the dreaming brain render it an ``endogenous'' Morel's machine, which can potentially be used in studying consciousness, but not always in a reliable way. Both the literary machine and dreaming could contribute to a better understanding of conscious states.},

In this context, web browsers behave as application containers that allow users to access a variety of Cloud-based applications and services, such as IDEs, Word processors, Music Collection Managers, etc. As a result, a significant part of these software run in the browser and accesses remote services. A lesson learned from development framework used in distributed applications is the success of pluggable architecture pattern as a core architecture concept, i.e., a Software Architecture that promotes the use of Pluggable Module to dynamically plug. Following this trend, this paper discusses the main challenges to create a component-based platform supporting the development of dynamically adaptable single web page applications. This paper also presents an approach called KevoreeJS based on models@runtime to control browser as component platform which address some of these challenges. We validate this work by presenting the design of a dashboard for sensor based system and highlighting the capacity of KevoreeJS to dynamically choose the placement of code on the server or client side and how KevoreeJS can be used to dynamically install or remove running components. \&copy; 2016 IEEE.},

We introduce an event-based tone mapping methodology for asynchronously acquired time encoded gray-level data. A global and a local tone mapping operator are proposed. Both are designed to operate on a stream of incoming events rather than on time frame windows. Experimental results on real outdoor scenes are presented to evaluate the performance of the tone mapping operators in terms of quality, temporal stability, adaptation capability, and computational time.},

The recent development of neural photosensitization tools, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), offers new opportunities for non-invasive, flexible and cell-specific neuronal stimulation. Previously, complex spatiotemporal control of photosensitized neurons has been limited by the lack of appropriate optical devices which can provide 2D stimulation with sufficient irradiance. Here we present a simple and powerful solution that is based on an array of high-power micro light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) that can generate arbitrary optical excitation patterns on a neuronal sample with micrometre and millisecond resolution. We first describe the design and fabrication of the system and characterize its capabilities. We then demonstrate its capacity to elicit precise electrophysiological responses in cultured and slice neurons expressing ChR2.},

  abstract = {Technologies for silencing the electrical activity of genetically-targeted neurons in the brain are important for assessing the contribution of specific cell types and pathways towards behaviors and pathologies. Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain \{TP\}009, which we named \{ArchT\}, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (\{$\backslash$textasciitilde\}900 \{pA\}), but with a 3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, equating to 2x increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber (notably, in the typical optogenetic range of 1-10 \{mW\}/mm2). Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, \{ArchT\} expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore \{ArchT\} function in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of \{ArchT\}-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (\{$\backslash$textasciitilde\}100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/sec upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that \{ArchT\} silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Background: Electrical stimulus isolator is a widely used device in electrophysiology. The timing of the stimulus application is usually automated and controlled by the external device or acquisition software; however, the intensity of the stimulus is adjusted manually. Inaccuracy, lack of reproducibility and no automation of the experimental protocol are disadvantages of the manual adjustment. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed StimDuino, an inexpensive Arduino-controlled stimulus isolator allowing highly accurate, reproducible automated setting of the stimulation current. New method: The intensity of the stimulation current delivered by StimDuino is controlled by Arduino, an open-source microcontroller development platform. The automatic stimulation patterns are software-controlled and the parameters are set from Matlab-coded simple, intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. The software also allows remote control of the device over the network. Results: Electrical current measurements showed that StimDuino produces the requested current output with high accuracy. In both hippocampal slice and in vivo recordings, the fEPSP measurements obtained with StimDuino and the commercial stimulus isolators showed high correlation. Comparison with existing methods: Commercial stimulus isolators are manually managed, while StimDuino generates automatic stimulation patterns with increasing current intensity. The pattern is utilized for the input-output relationship analysis, necessary for assessment of excitability. In contrast to StimuDuino, not all commercial devices are capable for remote control of the parameters and stimulation process. Conclusions: StimDuino-generated automation of the input-output relationship assessment eliminates need for the current intensity manually adjusting, improves stimulation reproducibility, accuracy and allows on-site and remote control of the stimulation parameters.},

  abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and Artificial Life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the one millisecond time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

  abstract = {Diverse optogenetic tools have allowed versatile control over neural activity. Many depolarizing and hyperpolarizing tools have now been developed in multiple laboratories and tested across different preparations, presenting opportunities but also making it difficult to draw direct comparisons. This challenge has been compounded by the dependence of performance on parameters such as vector, promoter, expression time, illumination, cell type and many other variables. As a result, it has become increasingly complicated for end users to select the optimal reagents for their experimental needs. For a rapidly growing field, critical figures of merit should be formalized both to establish a framework for further development and so that end users can readily understand how these standardized parameters translate into performance. Here we systematically compared microbial opsins under matched experimental conditions to extract essential principles and identify key parameters for the conduct, design and interpretation of experiments involving optogenetic techniques.},

This technique can preserve high spatial frequency information by exploiting the temporal correlation of stationary regions without any extra storage or transmission bandwidth. Coding complexity can be reduced by a factor of four if the video is to be eventually displayed in high-resolution, with small degradation in visual quality and peak-signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the edge information can be preserved when the low-resolution video is converted back to high-resolution video and significant improvement can be obtained compared with conventional methods.},

In particular, oscillations at around 20 Hz, in the so-called beta frequency band, relate to the cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can significantly improve these motor impairments. Recent evidence has demonstrated reduction of beta oscillations concurrent with alleviation of PD motor symptoms, raising the possibility that suppression of aberrant activity may mediate the effects of DBS. Here we review the evidence supporting suppression of pathological oscillations during stimulation and discuss how this might underlie the efficacy of DBS. We also consider how beta activity may provide a feedback signal suitable for next generation closed-loop and intelligent stimulators.},

  abstract = {A sensitive amperometric biosensor based on gold nanoelectrode array (NEA) was investigated. The gold nanoelectrode array was fabricated by template-assisted electrodeposition on general electrodes, which shows an ordered well-defined 3D structure of nanowires. The sensitivity of the gold NEA to hydrogen peroxide is 37 times higher than that of the conventional electrode. The linear range of the platinum NEA toward H2O2 is from 1 \texttimes{} 10-6 to 1 \texttimes{} 10-2 M, covering four orders of magnitudes with detection limit of 1 \texttimes{} 10-7 M and a single noise ratio (S/N) of four. The enzyme electrode exhibits an excellent response performance to glucose with linear range from 1 \texttimes{} 10-5 to 1 \texttimes{} 10-2 M and a fast response time within 8 s. The Michaelis\textendash{}Menten constant km and the maximum current density i max of the enzyme electrode were 4.97 mM and 84.60 $\mu$A cm-2, respectively. This special nanoelectrode may find potential application in other biosensors based on amperometric signals.},

  abstract = {Microelectrode recording (MER) is an important navigational and investigational tool, specifically with regard to deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. MER is often utilized when targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other deep brain nuclei in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), tremor, dystonia and other emerging applications. Microelectrodes are used to detect and measure cellular spiking activity while macroelectrodes are considered more suitable for measuring the collective sum of slow potentials from multiple cells near the electrode, the local field potential (LFP). Precisely how the characteristics of an electrode affect the data recorded is still unclear. Technical idiosyncrasies of some surgical cases allowed serendipitous data collection from a 250 to 6000 Hz bandpassed macroelectrode recording during DBS implantation for PD. Simultaneous recording from both a microelectrode and macroelectrode were compared along the same surgical trajectory. Audio, normalized root mean square of the recorded signal, and power spectrograms were used to analyze the data. The analyses demonstrate similar results in detecting cellular spiking activity when recording with macroelectrodes compared with microelectrodes. This has important implications for the standardization of recording electrophysiological data as well as for the development of next generation closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and \{ForceAtlas\}2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. \{ForceAtlas\}2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

It allows for simulation of both cloth; soft and rigid bodies; and even articulated or constrained bodies using both forward and inverse kinematics. The algorithms were developed for IO Interactive?s game Hitman: Codename 47. There, among other things, the physics system was responsible for the movement of cloth, plants, rigid bodies, and for making dead human bodies fall in unique ways depending on where they were hit, fully interacting with the environment (resulting in the press oxymoron ?lifelike death animations?).The article also deals with subtleties like penetration test optimization and friction handling.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the temporal characteristics of calcium dynamics obtained through widefield imaging can be utilized to infer the corresponding behavior. Cortical activity in transgenic calcium reporter mice (n=6) expressing GCaMP6f in neocortical pyramidal neurons is recorded during active whisking (AW) and no whisking (NW). To extract features related to the temporal characteristics of calcium recordings, a method based on visibility graph (VG) is introduced. An extensive study considering different choices of features and classifiers is conducted to find the best model capable of predicting AW and NW from calcium recordings. Our experimental results show that temporal characteristics of calcium recordings identified by the proposed method carry discriminatory information that are powerful enough for decoding behavior.},

Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, depression and addiction.

In the first step we use a novel scheme to approximate the hypergraph using a weighted graph. In the second step a spectral partitioning algorithm is used to partition the vertices of this graph. The algorithm is capable of handling hyperedges of all orders including order two, thus incorporating information of all orders simultaneously. We present a theoretical analysis that relates our algorithm to an existing hypergraph partitioning algorithm and explain the reasons for its superior performance. We report the performance of our algorithm on a variety of computer vision problems and compare it to several existing hypergraph partitioning algorithms.},

  abstract = {The ability of mass spectrometry to generate intact biomolecular ions efficiently in the gas phase has led to its widespread application in metabolomics, proteomics, biological imaging, biomarker discovery and clinical assays (namely neonatal screens). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization have been at the forefront of these developments. However, matrix application complicates the use of MALDI for cellular, tissue, biofluid and microarray analysis and can limit the spatial resolution because of the matrix crystal size (typically more than 10 mum), sensitivity and detection of small compounds (less than 500 Da). Secondary-ion mass spectrometry has extremely high lateral resolution (100 nm) and has found biological applications although the energetic desorption/ionization is a limitation owing to molecular fragmentation. Here we introduce nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), a tool for spatially defined mass analysis. NIMS uses 'initiator' molecules trapped in nanostructured surfaces or 'clathrates' to release and ionize intact molecules adsorbed on the surface. This surface responds to both ion and laser irradiation. The lateral resolution (ion-NIMS about 150 nm), sensitivity, matrix-free and reduced fragmentation of NIMS allows direct characterization of peptide microarrays, direct mass analysis of single cells, tissue imaging, and direct characterization of blood and urine.},

  abstract = {The effects of drunk driving are a significant risk to public health and safety. Accordingly, the federal government and the states have enacted laws that permit law enforcement to identify offenders and to apply various levels of sanctions. There is no constitutional requirement that evidence of drunkenness be permitted in defense of criminal behavior. In practice, citizens who undertake to operate motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol are considered reckless per se and have no right to obstruct law enforcement in determining their condition. Indeed, refusal of roadside sobriety tests, including the Breathalyzer, may be considered a separate offense. The issuing of Miranda-type warnings by police officers has been ruled on recently in New Jersey. In a superior court appellate decision, State v. Spell, the court outlined the necessary procedures, concluding that, although motorists have no right to refuse testing, police officers have an obligation to issue sufficient warnings before the motorist decides how to proceed. In the Spell matter, the defendant incriminated himself by refusing the testing, even though he was acquitted on the drunk-driving charge. The authors discuss the role of expert testimony in these matters.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers are focusing on a new use of the Internet called the Internet of Things (IoT), in which enabled electronic devices can be remotely accessed over the Internet. As the realization of IoT concept is still in its early stages, manufacturers of Internet-connected devices and IoT web service providers are defining their proprietary protocols based on their targeted applications. Consequently, IoT becomes heterogeneous in terms of hardware capabilities and communication protocols. Addressing these heterogeneities by following open standards is a necessary step to communicate with various IoT devices. In this research, we assess the feasibility of applying existing open standards on resource-constrained IoT devices. The standard protocols developed in this research are OGC PUCK over Bluetooth, TinySOS, SOS over CoAP, and OGC SensorThings API. We believe that by hosting open standard protocols on IoT devices, not only do the devices become self-describable, self-contained, and interoperable, but innovative applications can also be easily developed with standardized interfaces. In addition, we use memory consumption, request message size, response message size, and response latency to benchmark the efficiency of the implemented protocols. In all, this research presents and evaluates standard-based solutions to better understand the feasibility of applying existing standards to the IoT vision.},

  abstract = {The rapid decline in bumblebee populations within Europe has been linked to habitat loss through agricultural intensification, and a consequential reduction in the availability of preferred forage plants. The successful introduction of four European Bombus species to the South Island of New Zealand from England (in 1885 and 1906) provides an opportunity to determine how important different forage plants (also introduced from the U.K.) are to two severely threatened European bumblebee species (Bombus ruderatus and B. subterraneus). In January 2003 we conducted a survey of bumblebee populations across 70 sites in the central and southern South Island, recording which plant species were being used as pollen and nectar sources for each Bombus species. All four bumblebee species showed a clear preference for plants of European origin. Only B. terrestris, the most polylectic species, was recorded feeding on native plant species. The longer-tongued bumblebees, B. hortorum, B. ruderatus, and B. subterraneus, foraged predominantly on just two plant species; Trifolium pratense for both nectar and pollen, and Echium vulgare for nectar. These plant species are now declining in abundance in the U.K. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the loss of flower-rich meadows, particularly those containing populations of Fabaceae species with long corollae, is responsible for the decline of bumblebee species across Europe. Comparison with earlier bumblebee surveys suggests that long-tongued bumblebees may also be in decline in New Zealand, particularly B. subterraneus which is now very localised and scarce.},

Here we report techniques for long-term two-photon imaging in awake macaque monkeys. Using genetically encoded indicators including GCaMP5 and GCaMP6s delivered by AAV2/1 into the visual cortex, we demonstrate that high-quality two-photon imaging of large neuronal populations can be achieved and maintained in awake monkeys for months. Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10~Hz to 150~Hz). By providing two-photon imaging access to cortical neuronal populations at single-cell or single dendritic spine resolution in awake monkeys, the techniques reported can help bridge the use of modern genetic and molecular tools and the study of higher cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the brain controls behavior requires observing and manipulating neural activity in awake behaving animals. Neuronal firing is timed at millisecond precision. Therefore, to decipher temporal coding, it is necessary to monitor and control animal behavior at the same level of temporal accuracy. However, it is technically challenging to deliver sensory stimuli and reinforcers as well as to read the behavioral responses they elicit with millisecond precision. Presently available commercial systems often excel in specific aspects of behavior control, but they do not provide a customizable environment allowing flexible experimental design while maintaining high standards for temporal control necessary for interpreting neuronal activity. Moreover, delay measurements of stimulus and reinforcement delivery are largely unavailable. We combined microcontroller-based behavior control with a sound delivery system for playing complex acoustic stimuli, fast solenoid valves for precisely timed reinforcement delivery and a custom-built sound attenuated chamber using high-end industrial insulation materials. Together this setup provides a physical environment to train head-fixed animals, enables calibrated sound stimuli and precisely timed fluid and air puff presentation as reinforcers. We provide latency measurements for stimulus and reinforcement delivery and an algorithm to perform such measurements on other behavior control systems. Combined with electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations, the millisecond timing accuracy will help interpret temporally precise neural signals and behavioral changes. Additionally, since software and hardware provided here can be readily customized to achieve a large variety of paradigms, these solutions enable an unusually flexible design of rodent behavioral experiments.},

However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature.},

The former encourages us to repeat an action or activity, whereas the latter leads us to find an alternative strategy. Understanding the neural representation of these unexpected events is therefore critical to elucidate learning-related circuits. We examined the activity of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and caudate nucleus of monkeys as they performed a trial-and-error learning task. Unexpected outcomes were widely represented in both structures, and neurons driven by unexpectedly negative outcomes were as frequent as those activated by unexpectedly positive outcomes. Moreover, both positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) were represented primarily by increases in firing rate, unlike the manner in which dopamine neurons have been observed to reflect these values. Interestingly, positive RPEs tended to appear with shorter latency than negative RPEs, perhaps reflecting the mechanism of their generation. Last, in the PFC but not the caudate, trial-by-trial variations in outcome-related activity were linked to the animals' subsequent behavioral decisions. More broadly, the robustness of RPE signaling by these neurons suggests that actor-critic models of reinforcement learning in which the PFC and particularly the caudate are considered primarily to be ``actors'' rather than ``critics,'' should be reconsidered to include a prominent evaluative role for these structures.},

  abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging enables functional analysis of neuronal circuits by inferring action potential (AP) occurrence ("spike trains") from cellular fluorescence signals. It remains unclear how experimental parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition rate affect spike inference and whether additional information about network structure can be extracted. Here we present a simulation framework for quantitatively assessing how well spike dynamics and network topology can be inferred from noisy calcium imaging data. For simulated AP-evoked calcium transients in neocortical pyramidal cells, we analyzed the quality of spike inference as a function of SNR and data acquisition rate using a recently introduced peeling algorithm. Given experimentally attainable values of SNR and acquisition rate, neural spike trains could be reconstructed accurately and with up to millisecond precision. We then applied statistical neuronal network models to explore how remaining uncertainties in spike inference affect estimates of network connectivity and topological features of network organization. We define the experimental conditions suitable for inferring whether the network has a scale-free structure and determine how well hub neurons can be identified. Our findings provide a benchmark for future calcium imaging studies that aim to reliably infer neuronal network properties.},

The proposed architecture comprises three key components: spatial-spectral encoded optical camera design, over-complete HS dictionary learning and sparse-constraint computational reconstruction. Our spatial-spectral encoded sampling scheme provides a higher degree of randomness in the measured projections than previous compressive HS imaging approaches; and a robust nonlinear sparse reconstruction method is employed to recover the HS images from the coded projection with higher performance. To exploit the sparsity constraint on the nature HS images for computational reconstruction, an over-complete HS dictionary is learned to represent the HS images in a sparser way than previous representations. We validate the proposed approach on both synthetic and real captured data, and show successful recovery of HS images for both indoor and outdoor scenes. In addition, we demonstrate other applications for the over-complete HS dictionary and sparse coding techniques, including 3D HS images compression and denoising.},

  shorttitle = {Evolution of the Archaeal Rhodopsins},
  abstract = {The amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family (ARF), which was not related to other known proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors. The archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions; H+ pump (bacteriorhodopsin), Cl- pump (halorhodopsin), and two kinds of sensor (sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin). These four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplication(s) before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea, based on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea. By comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree, we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin:halorhodopsin:sensory rhodopsin: phoborhodopsin to be 5:4:3:10. From these values, the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred. The branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping. Using bacteriorhodopsin (and halorhodopsin) as an outgroup, the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsin/phoborhodopsin was determined. By calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point, we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin. The evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin, which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin, and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations. The changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps.},

The 3D shape of an object class is represented by sets of contours from silhouette views simultaneously observed from multiple calibrated cameras, while structural features of interest on the object are denoted by a number of 3D locations. A prior density over the multiview shape and corresponding structure is constructed with a mixture of probabilistic principal components analyzers. Given a novel set of contours, we infer the unknown structure parameters from the new shape's Bayesian reconstruction. Model matching and parameter inference are done entirely in the image domain and require no explicit 3D construction. Our shape model enables accurate estimation of structure despite segmentation errors or missing views in the input silhouettes, and it works even with only a single input view. Using a training set of thousands of pedestrian images generated from a synthetic model, we can accurately infer the 3D locations of 19 joints on the body based on observed silhouette contours from real images.},

  abstract = {Drugs of abuse generate diverse behavioral and physiological effects. One feature common to many abused drugs is the phenomenon of ``withdrawal,'' which results from abrupt termination of drug administration. The initial phases of drug withdrawal, often referred to as the ``crash'' phase in humans, are characterized by dramatic psychological changes which may or may not be accompanied by somatic symptoms. The psychological symptoms, including disruptions in affect and cognition, are most commonly observed following psychostimulant withdrawal. This transient state strongly resembles the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans. The majority of rodent paradigms of psychostimulant withdrawal accurately model this human condition, and sophisticated preclinical protocols have been used to quantify psychological changes, such as anhedonia. In the present review, we describe past and current progress in modeling psychostimulant withdrawal in rodents, as well as potential limitations of this model.},

Studies employing these advanced techniques revealed that synchronization of oscillatory responses in the $\beta$- and $\gamma$-band is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, routing of signals across distributed cortical networks, sensory-motor integration, working memory, and perceptual awareness. Here, we review evidence that certain brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's are associated with abnormal neural synchronization. The data suggest close correlations between abnormalities in neuronal synchronization and cognitive dysfunctions, emphasizing the importance of temporal coordination. Thus, focused search for abnormalities in temporal patterning may be of considerable clinical relevance.},

  abstract = {The CXCR4 chemokine receptor is a G(i) protein-coupled receptor that triggers multiple intracellular signals in response to stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), including calcium mobilization and p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2). Transduced signals lead to cell chemotaxis and are terminated through receptor internalization depending on phosphorylation of the C terminus part of CXCR4. Receptor endocytosis is also required for some receptors to stimulate ERK1/2 and to migrate through a chemokine gradient. In this study, we explored the role played by the 3 intracellular loops (ICL1-3) and the C terminus domain of CXCR4 in SDF-1-mediated signaling by using human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutated forms of CXCR4. ICL3 of CXCR4 is specifically involved in G(i)-dependent signals such as calcium mobilization and ERK activation, but does not trigger CXCR4 internalization after SDF-1 binding, indicating that ERK phosphorylation is independent of CXCR4 endocytosis. Surprisingly, ICL2, with or without the aspartic acid, arginine, and tyrosine (DRY) motif, is dispensable for G(i) signaling. However, ICL2 and ICL3, as well as the C terminus part of CXCR4, are needed to transduce SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis, suggesting that this event involves multiple activation pathways and/or cooperation of several cytoplasmic domains of CXCR4.},

  abstract = {ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike---a feat that arguably no other image analysis package, commercial or open source, has yet achieved. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical sciences, making ImageJ an invaluable resource across countless disciplines. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework adaptable to future needs, enabling continued success and innovation.},

Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand ani- mation.We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those cre- ated manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture sys- tem to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art- directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},

  abstract = {We explore the use of inexpensive consumer light- field camera technology for the purpose of light-field mi- croscopy. Our experiments are based on the Lytro (first gen- eration) camera. Unfortunately, the optical systems of the Lytro and those of microscopes are not compatible, lead- ing to a loss of light-field information due to angular and spatial vignetting when directly recording microscopic pic- tures. We therefore consider an adaptation of the Lytro op- tical system. We demonstrate that using the Lytro directly as an oc- ular replacement, leads to unacceptable spatial vignetting. However, we also found a setting that allows the use of the Lytro camera in a virtual imaging mode which prevents the information loss to a large extent. We analyze the new vir- tual imaging mode and use it in two different setups for im- plementing light-field microscopy using a Lytro camera. As a practical result, we show that the camera can be used for low magnification work, as e.g. common in quality control, surface characterization, etc. We achieve a maximum spa- tial resolution of about 6.25\{$\backslash$mu\}m, albeit at a limited SNR for the side views.},

Simultaneous optical imaging in two bands is enabled by a dichroic beam splitter centered at 567 nm, with Sloan u' and g' bands available on the blue arm and Sloan r', i' and z\_s' bands available on the red arm. Additional narrow-band filters will also become available as required. An Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) detector is employed for both optical channels, each capable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under multiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000 fps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. CHIMERA was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).},

  abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of \$n\$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex \$S\_\{n-1\}\$, which is the set of all probability distributions over \$n\$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \$$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{p\}\}\$ to distribution \$$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{q\}\}\$, where \$$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{p\}\}\$, \$$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{q\}\} \{$\backslash$textbackslash\}in S\_\{n-1\}\$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \$C($\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{p\}\}, $\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{q\}\})\$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \$$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{p\}\}=$\backslash$\{\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}mathbf\{q\}\}\$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \$S\_\{n-1\} \{$\backslash$textbackslash\}times S\_\{n-1\}\$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are a promising means for restoring communication to patients suffering from ``locked-in'' syndrome. Research to improve system performance primarily focuses on means to overcome the low signal to noise ratio of electroencephalogric (EEG) recordings. However, the literature and methods are difficult to compare due to the array of evaluation metrics and assumptions underlying them, including that: 1) all characters are equally probable, 2) character selection is memoryless, and 3) errors occur completely at random. The standardization of evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the amount of information contained in BCI language output is critical to make progress. We present a mutual information-based metric that incorporates prior information and a model of systematic errors. The parameters of a system used in one study were re-optimized, showing that the metric used in optimization significantly affects the parameter values chosen and the resulting system performance. The results of 11 BCI communication studies were then evaluated using different metrics, including those previously used in BCI literature and the newly advocated metric. Six studies' results varied based on the metric used for evaluation and the proposed metric produced results that differed from those originally published in two of the studies. Standardizing metrics to accurately reflect the rate of information transmission is critical to properly evaluate and compare BCI communication systems and advance the field in an unbiased manner.},

  abstract = {Background Since the first deep brain stimulation (DBS) performed for movement disorder more than a decade ago, DBS has become a standard operation for advanced Parkinson's disease. Its indications are expanding to areas of dystonia, psychiatric conditions and refractory epilepsy. Additionally, a new set of DBS-related complications have arisen. Many teams found a slow learning curve from this complication-prone operation. We would like to investigate complications arising from 100 DBS electrode insertions and its prevention. Methods We performed an audit in all DBS patients for operation-related complications in our centre from 1997 to 2008. Complications were classified into operation-related, hardware-related and stimulation-related. Operation-related complications included intracranial haemorrhages and electrode malposition. Hardware-related complications included fracture of electrodes, electrode migration, infection and erosion. Stimulation-related complications included sensorimotor conditions, psychiatric conditions and life-threatening conditions. Results From 1997 to the end of 2008, 100 DBS electrodes were inserted in 55 patients for movement disorders, mostly for Parkinson's disease (50 patients). There was one symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage (1\%) and two electrode malpositions (2\%). Meticulous surgical planning, use of microdriver and a reliable electrode anchorage device would minimise this group of complications. There were two electrode fractures, one electrode migration and one pulse-generator infection which contributed to the hardware-related complication rate of 5\%. There was no sensorimotor or life-threatening complications in our group. However, three patients suffered from reversible psychiatric symptoms after DBS. Conclusion DBS is, on the one hand, an effective surgical treatment for movement disorders. On the other hand, it is a complication-prone operation. A dedicated ``Movement Disorder Team'' consisting of neurologists, neurophysiologists, functional neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists and nursing specialists is essential. Liaison among team members in perioperative periods and postoperative care is the key to avoiding complications and having a successful patient outcome.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Light field cameras have many advantages over traditional cameras, as they allow the user to change various camera settings after capture. However, capturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern light field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current consumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames. Instead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video camera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence and a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field video at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed into two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The flow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field sequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The appearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final pixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current video interpolation methods, enabling consumer light field videography, and making applications such as refocusing and parallax view generation achievable on videos for the first time.},

  abstract = {Distributed compression is the task of compressing correlated data by several parties, each one possessing one piece of data and acting separately. The classical Slepian-Wolf theorem (D. Slepian, J. K. Wolf, IEEE Transactions on Inf. Theory, 1973) shows that if data is generated by independent draws from a joint distribution, that is by a memoryless stochastic process, then distributed compression can achieve the same compression rates as centralized compression when the parties act together. Recently, the author (M. Zimand, STOC 2017) has obtained an analogue version of the Slepian-Wolf theorem in the framework of Algorithmic Information Theory (also known as Kolmogorov complexity). The advantage over the classical theorem, is that the AIT version works for individual strings, without any assumption regarding the generative process. The only requirement is that the parties know the complexity profile of the input strings, which is a simple quantitative measure of the data correlation. The goal of this paper is to present in an accessible form that omits some technical details the main ideas from the reference (M. Zimand, STOC 2017).},

  doi = {10.1109/TSE.2002.1000452},
  abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that there is an optimal size for software components. This means that components that are too small or too big will have a higher defect content (i.e., there is a U-shaped curve relating defect content to size). The U-shaped curve has become known as the "Goldilocks Conjecture." Recently, a cognitive theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon and it has been expanded to characterize object-oriented software. This conjecture has wide implications for software engineering practice. It suggests 1) that designers should deliberately strive to design classes that are of the optimal size, 2) that program decomposition is harmful, and 3) that there exists a maximum (threshold) class size that should not be exceeded to ensure fewer faults in the software. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate this conjecture for object-oriented systems. We first demonstrate that the claims of an optimal component/class size (1) above) and of smaller components/classes having a greater defect content (2) above) are due to a mathematical artifact in the analyses performed previously. We then empirically test the threshold effect claims of this conjecture (3) above). To our knowledge, the empirical test of size threshold effects for object-oriented systems has not been performed thus far. We performed an initial study with an industrial C++ system and repeated it twice on another C++ system and on a commercial Java application. Our results provide unambiguous evidence that there is no threshold effect of class size. We obtained the same result for three systems using four different size measures. These findings suggest that there is a simple continuous relationship between class size and faults, and that, optimal class size, smaller classes are better and threshold effects conjectures have no sound theoretical nor empirical basis},

This two-way communication allows us to monitor the state of the brain and its composite networks and cells as well as to influence them to treat disease or repair/restore sensory or motor function. To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.

  abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10\%.},

Here we present a closed-loop real-time imaging strategy that automatically compensates for cell movement by tracking cell position and adjusting pipette motion while approaching a target. We demonstrate our system's ability to adaptively patch, under continuous two-photon imaging and real-time analysis, fluorophore-expressing neurons of multiple types in the living mouse cortex, without human intervention, with yields comparable to skilled human experimenters. Our ``imagepatching'' robot is easy to implement and will help enable scalable characterization of identified cell types in intact neural circuits.},

We analyzed the content and information quality of the first 200 websites returned by a Google.com search on SCT. Most websites returned were from treatment centers (TC, 44\%) followed by news and medical professional websites. The specialty most mentioned in non-TC websites was ``neurological'' (67\%), followed by ``cardiovascular'' (42\%), while the most frequent indication for which SCT is offered by TCs was musculoskeletal (89\%) followed by neurological (47\%). 45\% of the centers specialized in treating one specialty, 10\% two and 45\% offered between three and 18 different specialties. Of the 78 treatment centers, 65\% were in the USA, 23\% in Asia and 8\% in Latin America. None of the centers offered SCT based on embryonic cells. Health information quality (JAMA score, measuring trustworthiness) was lowest for TCs and commercial websites and highest for scientific journals and health portals. This study shows a disconnection between information about SCT and what is actually offered by TCs. The study also shows that TCs, potentially acting in a regulatory grey area, have a high visibility on the Internet.},

  abstract = {The application of fluorescence microscopy in cell biology often generates a huge amount of imaging data. Automated whole cell segmentation of such data enables the detection and analysis of individual cells, where a manual delineation is often time consuming, or practically not feasible. Furthermore, compared to manual analysis, automation normally has a higher degree of reproducibility. CellSegm, the software presented in this work, is a Matlab based command line software toolbox providing an automated whole cell segmentation of images showing surface stained cells, acquired by fluorescence microscopy. It has options for both fully automated and semi-automated cell segmentation. Major algorithmic steps are: (i) smoothing, (ii) Hessian-based ridge enhancement, (iii) marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and (iv) feature-based classfication of cell candidates. Using a wide selection of image recordings and code snippets, we demonstrate that CellSegm has the ability to detect various types of surface stained cells in 3D. After detection and outlining of individual cells, the cell candidates can be subject to software based analysis, specified and programmed by the end-user, or they can be analyzed by other software tools. A segmentation of tissue samples with appropriate characteristics is also shown to be resolvable in CellSegm. The command-line interface of CellSegm facilitates scripting of the separate tools, all implemented in Matlab, offering a high degree of flexibility and tailored workflows for the end-user. The modularity and scripting capabilities of CellSegm enable automated workflows and quantitative analysis of microscopic data, suited for high-throughput image based screening.},

  abstract = {While Kolmogorov complexity is the accepted absolute measure of information content in an individual nite object, a similarly absolute notion is needed for the information distance between two individual objects, for example, two pictures. We give several natural denitions of a universal information metric, based on length of shortest programs for either ordinary computations or reversible (dissipationless) computations. It turns out that these denitions are equivalent up to an additive logarithmic term. We show that the information distance is a universal cognitive similarity distance. We investigate the maximal correlation of the shortest programs involved, the maximal uncorrelation of programs (a generalization of the Slepian-Wolf theorem of classical information theory), and the density properties of the discrete metric spaces induced by the information distances. A related distance measures the amount of nonreversibility of a computation. Using the physical theory of reversible computation, we give an appropriate (universal, anti-symmetric, and transitive) measure of the thermodynamic work required to transform one object in another object by the most efcient process. Information distance between individual objects is needed in pattern recognition where one wants to express effective notions of pattern similarity or cognitive similarity between individual objects and in thermodynamics of computation where one wants to analyse the energy dissipation of a computation from a particular input to a particular output.},

  abstract = {The rise of neural networks, and particularly recurrent neural networks, has produced significant advances in part-of-speech tagging accuracy. One characteristic common among these models is the presence of rich initial word encodings. These encodings typically are composed of a recurrent character-based representation with learned and pre-trained word embeddings. However, these encodings do not consider a context wider than a single word and it is only through subsequent recurrent layers that word or sub-word information interacts. In this paper, we investigate models that use recurrent neural networks with sentence-level context for initial character and word-based representations. In particular we show that optimal results are obtained by integrating these context sensitive representations through synchronized training with a meta-model that learns to combine their states. We present results on part-of-speech and morphological tagging with state-of-the-art performance on a number of languages.},

  abstract = {To review 16 years of National Collegiate Athletic Association injury surveillance data for women's lacrosse and identify potential areas for injury prevention initiatives. Women's lacrosse is a fast-paced, primarily noncontact sport. Participation in collegiate women's lacrosse almost doubled between the 1988-1989 and 2003-2004 seasons. Lacrosse equipment consists of sticks made of wood or a synthetic material and a hard rubber ball. Until recently, mouth guards were the only required protective equipment. Collegiate women's lacrosse game injury rates increased over the 16-year study period. More than 60\% of all severe game injuries were lower extremity sprains and strains and knee internal derangements, most frequently the result of noncontact incidents. The most common injury scenarios by injury mechanism and player activity were no contact while ball handling (16.4\%) and contact from a stick while ball handling (10.5\%). Contact from a stick or a ball accounted for 5.6\% and 5.2\% of injuries sustained during shooting activities, respectively. Approximately 22\% of all game and 12\% of all practice injuries involved the head and neck. Contact from a stick accounted for the majority (56.0\%) of above-the-neck injuries in games; contact from the ball accounted for 20.0\% of these injuries. Participants had 5 times the risk of sustaining a concussion in a game as in a practice (0.70 versus 0.15 injuries per 1000 athletic-exposures, rate ratio = 4.7, 95\% confidence interval = 3.8, 6.5). To reduce the lower extremity injuries that comprise the greatest injury burden in women's lacrosse, future researchers should evaluate proprioceptive, plyometric, and balance training interventions designed specifically for female players. Other research areas of great interest involve determining whether protective eyewear (mandated in 2004) reduces injuries to the eye, orbit, and nasal area and identifying any unintended consequences of the mandate, such as increased risk of injuries to other areas of the face or more aggressive play.},

Behavioral data analysis revealed a less risky, more careful choice behavior under active DBS compared to DBS switched off. PET showed win- and loss-related activations in the paracingulate cortex, temporal poles, precuneus and hippocampus under active DBS, brain areas that have been implicated in action monitoring and behavioral control. Except for the temporal pole these activations were not seen when DBS was deactivated. These findings suggest that DBS of the NAcc may act partially by improving behavioral control.},

  abstract = {Embedded real-time vision applications are being rapidly deployed in a large realm of consumer electronics, ranging from automotive safety to surveillance systems. However, the relatively limited computational power of embedded platforms is considered as a bottleneck for many vision applications, necessitating optimization. OpenVX is a standardized interface, released in late 2014, in an attempt to provide both system and kernel level optimization to vision applications. With OpenVX, Vision processing are modeled with coarse-grained data flow graphs, which can be optimized and accelerated by the platform implementer. Current full implementations of OpenVX are given in the programming language C, which does not support advanced programming paradigms such as object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, nor does it have runtime or type-checking. Here we present a python-based full Implementation of OpenVX, which eliminates much of the discrepancies between the object-oriented paradigm used by many modern applications and the native C implementations. Our open-source implementation can be used for rapid development of OpenVX applications in embedded platforms. Demonstration includes static and real-time image acquisition and processing using a Raspberry Pi and a GoPro camera. Code is given as supplementary information. Code project and linked deployable virtual machine are located on GitHub: https://github.com/NBEL-lab/PythonOpenVX.},

Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the context and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions temporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a query-aware context representation without early summarization. Our experimental evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze test.},

In this study, we examine another role of TSP1 in the CNS, namely, in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that adult mice deficient in TSP1 exhibit reduced proliferation of NPCs in vivo [13,330+/-826 vs. 4914+/-455 (mean+/-se wt vs. TSP1(-/-)); P0.001, Student's t test] and impaired neuronal differentiation (1382+/-83 vs. 879+/-79; P0.001). In vitro, NPC obtained from adult TSP1(-/-) mice display decreased proliferation in BrdU assay (48+/-8 vs. 24+/-3.5\%; P0.01) and decreased neuronal fate commitment (8+/-0.85 vs. 4.6+/-0.5\%; P0.05) in contrast to wild-type NPCs. Both proliferation and neuronal differentiation deficits are remediable in vitro by exogenous TSP1. Notably, conditioned medium from TSP1(-/-) astrocytes, unlike that from control astrocytes, fails to promote neurogenesis in wild-type NPCs, suggesting that TSP1 is one of the key molecules responsible for astrocyte-induced neurogenesis. Our data demonstrate that TSP1 is a critical participant in maintenance of the adult NPC pool and in neuronal differentiation.},

  abstract = {We propose an original method for detecting and localizing anomalous motion patterns in videos from a camera view -based motion representation perspective. Anomalous motion should be taken in a broad sense, i.e., unexpected, abnormal, singular, irregular, or unusual motion. Identifying distinctive dynamic information at any time point and at any image location in a sequence of images is a key requirement in many situations and applications. The proposed method relies on so-called labeled affine flows (LAF) involving both affine velocity vectors and affine motion classes. At every pixel a motion class is inferred from the affine motion model selected in a set of candidate models estimated over a collection of windows. Then, the image is subdivided in blocks where motion class histograms weighted by the affine motion vector magnitudes are computed. They are compared blockwise to histograms of normal behaviours with a dedicated distance. More specifically, we introduce the local outlier factor (LOF) to detect anomalous blocks. LOF is a local flexible measure of the relative density of data points in a feature space, here the space of LAF histograms. By thresholding the LOF value, we can detect an anomalous motion pattern in any block at any time instant of the video sequence. The threshold value is automatically set in each block by means of statistical arguments. We report comparative experiments on several real video datasets, demonstrating that our method is highly competitive for the intricate task of detecting different types of anomalous motion in videos. Specifically, we obtain very competitive results on all the tested datasets: 99.2 \{$\backslash$textbackslash\}\% AUC for UMN, 82.8 \{$\backslash$textbackslash\}\% AUC for UCSD, and 95.73 \{$\backslash$textbackslash\}\% accuracy for PETS 2009, at the frame level.},

Imaging experiments typically generate a large amount of data that needs to be processed to extract the activity of the imaged neuronal sources. While deriving such processing algorithms is an active area of research, most existing methods require the processing of large amounts of data at a time, rendering them vulnerable to the volume of the recorded data, and preventing real-time experimental interrogation. Here we introduce OnACID, an Online framework for the Analysis of streaming Calcium Imaging Data, including i) motion artifact correction, ii) neuronal source extraction, and iii) activity denoising and deconvolution. Our approach combines and extends previous work on online dictionary learning and calcium imaging data analysis, to deliver an automated pipeline that can discover and track the activity of hundreds of cells in real time, thereby enabling new types of closed-loop experiments. We apply our algorithm on two large scale experimental datasets, benchmark its performance on manually annotated data, and show that it outperforms a popular offline approach.},

  abstract = {Information theory provides a principled and unified statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables (Ince et al., 2016a). This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni- and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods is available at: https://github.com/robince/gcmi We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We demonstrate the benefits of a multivariate statistical approach with examples such as MEG vector magnetic fields (including separate quantification of stimulus modulations of amplitude and direction) as well as considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a two-dimensional response. A particular advantage of the information theoretic framework is its ability to quantify representational interactions between different neuroimaging responses: for example, different cortical regions, frequency bands, time periods or recording modalities (i.e. simultaneous recorded EEG and fMRI). Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals. By combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space EEG data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information (DFI), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.},

Over the past several decades, the reinstatement procedure has received widespread use as an animal model of drug relapse, to study the basic mechanisms underlying drug-seeking responses in laboratory animals. The objectives of this chapter are twofold. The first is to describe the primary paradigms and procedures that have been developed to study reinstatement of drug-related behaviors in the laboratory. The second is to define and characterize the three major triggers of reinstatement to drug seeking that constitute the foundation of this work. These triggers include priming injections of a previously self-administered drug, reexposure to drug-associated cues, and exposure to stress. The role of these triggers in reinstatement will be characterized within the context of an overview of key behavioral findings in the literature and their theoretical implications.},

However, the high and fluctuating background, the inevitable movements and distortions of imaging field, and the extensive spatial overlaps of fluorescent signals emitted from imaged neurons inherent in this 1-photon imaging method present major challenges for extracting neuronal signals reliably and automatically from the raw imaging data. Here, we develop a unifying algorithm called the miniscope 1-photon imaging pipeline (\{MIN\}1PIPE), which contains several stand-alone modules and can handle a wide range of imaging conditions and qualities with minimal parameter tuning and automatically and accurately isolate spatially localized neural signals. We have quantitatively compared \{MIN\}1PIPE with other existing partial methods using both synthetic and real datasets obtained from different animal models and show that \{MIN\}1PIPE has superior efficiency and precision in analyzing noisy miniscope calcium imaging data.},

  title = {Avoiding {{Current Spikes}} with {{LEDs}}},
  url = {http://www.wikipedia.com},
  abstract = {Hot Switching creates current spikes that can destroy any LED. A properly designed driver is the simple solution. Unlike many illumination sources, such as incandescent bulbs that are voltage driven, LEDs are current driven devices. This distinction requires different considerations when designing and using driver electronics. We will compare incandescent bulbs to LEDs to highlight this subtle difference. The relationship between voltage and current is similar to the relationship between water pressure and water flow. Higher water pressure represents higher voltage and higher water flow represents higher current. One can observe flow or pressure, both or neither, depending on the system under consideration. For example, when compared to a standard garden hose, a fire hose has high pressure and high flow. Contrast this to the Amazon River which has a much higher flow and lower pressure. An example of high pressure and no flow is the water behind a dam. The dam acts like an open switch in an electronic circuit storing water (voltage) for immediate release. To fully understand the difference between incandescent bulbs and semiconductors such as LEDs, let us consider voltage driven devices for a minute. The filament of an incandescent bulb is simply a resistor. When electrically powered, the filament heats to near white hot temperature-more than 5,800$^\circ$F or 3,250$^\circ$C. The high temperature of the filament generates the light. When first powered, the filament is cold and has a much lower resistance than when it is hot. According to Ohm's law, V = I R, the current in the filament is higher when the bulb is first turned and the filament is cold. This current is known as the "in-rush" current. Very quickly after turn-on, the filament heats to its operating temperature. As the filament heats, the resistance goes up dramatically and the current drops proportionately. In much less than a second, the filament resistance stabilizes and the current is constant. Due to the characteristics of filaments, driver designs for bulbs expect an in-rush current as part of their performance. As long as the voltage is constant, bulbs tolerate these current fluctuations. However, bulbs are very sensitive to voltage variations. Different sources cite different levels of sensitivity, a recent check of Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.com) stated the lifetime of a bulb was dependant on the inverse of the sixteenth power of the voltage. In other words, an increase in voltage of only 5\% could have a dramatic effect on the lifetime of the bulb. Using the equation: Lifetime bulb = (105\% V rated / 100\% V rated) 16-representing a 5\% increase in Voltage Lifetime bulb = (1.05)-16 Lifetime bulb = 45.8\% of initial lifetime Simply stated, a 5\% increase in voltage decreases the bulb Lifetime by more than half. Therefore, for a robust product performance, incandescent bulbs depend on well-regulated voltages while being tolerant to some current fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Interstitial flow is the convective transport of fluid through tissue extracellular matrix. This creeping fluid flow has been shown to affect the morphology and migration of cells such as fibroblasts, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. A microfluidic cell culture system was designed to apply stable pressure gradients and fluid flow and allow direct visualization of transient responses of cells seeded in a 3D collagen type I scaffold. We used this system to examine the effects of interstitial flow on cancer cell morphology and migration and to extend previous studies showing that interstitial flow increases the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-435S melanoma cells [Shields J, et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 11:526\textendash{}538]. Using a breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-231) we also observed cell migration along streamlines in the presence of flow; however, we further demonstrated that the strength of the flow as well as the cell density determined directional bias of migration along the streamline. In particular, we found that cells either at high seeding density or with the CCR-7 receptor inhibited migration against, rather than with the flow. We provide further evidence that CCR7-dependent autologous chemotaxis is the mechanism that leads to migration with the flow, but also demonstrate a competing CCR7-independent mechanism that causes migration against the flow. Data from experiments investigating the effects of cell concentration, interstitial flow rate, receptor activity, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation support our hypothesis that the competing stimulus is integrin mediated. This mechanism may play an important role in development of metastatic disease.},

  abstract = {Local and superficial near-infrared (NIR) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source\textendash{}detector separations (1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function $\gamma$, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If $\gamma$ is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3\textendash{}1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine $\gamma$, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and $\gamma$ can be measured to within $\mp$0.005 mm-1, $\mp$0.05 mm-1, and $\mp$0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm3 in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter $\gamma$.},

Because many stream-oriented systems are inherently geographically distributed and because distribution offers scalable load management and higher availability, future stream processing systems will operate in a distributed fashion.

This paper describes the architectural challenges facing the design of large-scale distributed stream processing systems, and discusses novel approaches for addressing load management, high availability, and federated operation issues.

However, the practical adoption of code generation remains relatively slow and limited to niche applications. Tooling issues are often pointed out but more fundamentally, experience shows that: (i) models and modeling languages used for other purposes are not necessarily well suited for code generation and (ii) code generators are often seen as black-boxes which are not easy to trust and produce sub-optimal code. This paper presents and discusses our experiences applying the ThingML approach to different domains. ThingML includes a modeling language and tool designed for supporting code generation and a highly customizable multi-platform code generation framework. The approach is implemented in an open-source tool providing a family of code generators targeting heterogeneous platforms. It has been evaluated through several case studies and is being used for in the development of a commercial ambient assisted living system.},

They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high strong$\backslash$textit\{R\}\$\^\{$\backslash$textrm\{2\}\}\$/strong, the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.},

We demonstrate the generality of RACE by extracting cell-shape information from entire Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos imaged with confocal and light-sheet microscopes. Using RACE, we automatically reconstructed cellular-resolution tissue anisotropy maps across developing Drosophila embryos and quantified differences in cell-shape dynamics in wild-type and mutant embryos. We furthermore integrated RACE with our framework for automated cell lineaging and performed joint segmentation and cell tracking in entire Drosophila embryos. RACE processed these terabyte-sized datasets on a single computer within 1.4 days. RACE is easy to use, as it requires adjustment of only three parameters, takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multi-core processors and graphics cards, and is available as open-source software for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) emerged in the late 1960s as a possible therapeutic alternative to lesioning in patients with severe, chronic, intractable pain. DBS devices in the era were based on cardiac pacing technology but were greatly modified in implementation due to the unique needs of DBS. Clinical studies in the 1970s and early 1980s have revealed a technique with modest results which did not lead to regulatory approval for the treatment of pain. In the 1980s a new application for DBS emerged in the treatment of movement disorders. Clinical trials confirmed the robustness of the therapy leading to approvals by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe for the treatment of tremor and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Technology based on that used for earlier clinical research in pain was improved by leveraging advances in cardiac pacing technology resulting in the sophisticated and reliable systems available today. In the 1990s scientific exploration began in the treatment of psychiatric disorders which is ongoing today. Simultaneously, studies into the treatment of epilepsy were begun which resulted in regulatory approval in Europe. Suggestions have been made to expand these scientific explorations to other central nervous system dysfunctions. Opportunity remains to improve the technology including individualized and symptom specific stimulation patterns, more physician and patient friendly programming, and possibly closed-loop systems for more situation dependent and effective therapy.},

We developed a pooled high throughput screening approach to identify Archaerhodopsin mutants with unusual photophysical properties. After screening \~105 cells, we identified a novel GEVI, NovArch, whose 1-photon near infrared fluorescence is reversibly enhanced by weak 2-photon excitation. Because the 2-photon excitation acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically, high fluorescence signals, optical sectioning, and high time resolution are achieved simultaneously, at modest 2-photon laser power. We developed a microscopy system optimized for NovArch imaging in tissue. The combination of protein and optical engineering enhanced signal contrast sufficiently to enable optical mapping of back-propagating action potentials in dendrites in acute mouse brain slice.},

Because the microprobe is easily removed, one can also record intermittently from several animals at once.

  abstract = {Adaptation refers to the general phenomenon that the neural system dynamically adjusts its response property according to the statistics of external inputs. In response to an invariant stimulation, neuronal firing rates first increase dramatically and then decrease gradually to a low level close to the background activity. This prompts a question: during the adaptation, how does the neural system encode the repeated stimulation with attenuated firing rates? It has been suggested that the neural system may employ a dynamical encoding strategy during the adaptation, that is, at the early stage of the adaptation, the stimulus information is encoded mainly by the strong independent firings of neurons; and as time goes on, the encoding of the stimulus information is shifted to the weak but synchronized firings of neurons. The previous study demonstrated that short-term facilitation (STF) of electrical synapses, which increases the synchronization between neurons, can provide a mechanism to realize dynamical encoding. In the present study, we further explore whether short-term plasticity (STP) of chemical synapses, an interaction form more common than electrical synapse in the cortex, can support dynamical encoding. We build a large-size network with chemical synapses between neurons. Notably, facilitation of chemical synapses only enhances pair-wise correlations between neurons mildly, but its effect on increasing synchronization of the network can be significant, and hence it can serve as a mechanism to convey the stimulus information. To read-out the stimulus information, we consider that a downstream neuron receives balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the network, so that the downstream neuron only responds to synchronized firings of the network. Therefore, the response of the downstream neuron indicates the presence of the repeated stimulation. Overall, our study demonstrates that STP of chemical synapse can serve as a mechanism to realize dynamical neural encoding. We hope this study gives us insight into understanding how the brain processes information efficiently via adaptation.},

  abstract = {Nanomedicines have enormous potential to improve the precision of cancer therapy, yet our ability to efficiently home these materials to regions of disease in vivo remains very limited. Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of `signalling' modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted `receiving' nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash{}After the recent cloning of light-sensitive ion channels and their expression in mammalian cells, a new field, optogenetics, emerged in neuroscience, allowing for precise perturbations of neural circuits by light. However, functionality of optogenetic tools has not been fully explored outside neuroscience; and a non-viral, non-embryogenesis based strategy for optogenetics has not been shown before. Methods and Results\textemdash{}We demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit (\{TCU\}) strategy, where non-excitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically-excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 (\{ChR\}2) expressing cell line was developed, characterized and used as a cell delivery system. The \{TCU\} strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electrical waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically-triggered waves. Conclusions\textemdash{}Our results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light using the \{TCU\} approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control, remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research, but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators. The \{TCU\} strategy is extendable to (non-viral) stem cell therapy and is directly relevant to in vivo applications.},

  abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection has become endemic in many hospitals and yet few data on the associated costs of such cases are available. We prospectively followed 50 consecutive cases of C. difficile infection and 92 control patients, who were admitted to the same geriatric wards within 72 h of the cases. Cases and controls had similar age, sex and major diagnosis distributions. Cases stayed significantly longer (mean 21.3 days, median 20.5 days; P  0.001) in hospital than controls, including an average 14 days in a side room. Diarrhoea developed in cases on average 10.8 days after admission, which, when compared with a mean duration of stay for controls of 25.2 days, implies that C. difficile infection caused an increased duration of stay, as opposed to infection occurring because of longer residence. There was a significantly higher death rate in cases compared with controls (P  0.01). Antibiotic treatment of C. difficile infection cost an average of Pounds 47 per case. The average number of laboratory investigations per day was similar for cases and controls, but the increased length of stay meant an extra cost for tests of approximately Pounds 210 per case. Assuming hotel costs of Pounds 150 (Pounds 200) per day stay (in a side room), 94\% of the additional costs associated with C. difficile infection were due to increased duration of stay (Pounds 3850). The total identifiable increased cost of C. difficile infection was, therefore, in excess of Pounds 4000 per case. Such high costs can be used to justify expenditure on personnel and/or other control measures to reduce the incidence of this hospital-acquired infection.},

The approach is a natural extension of the classical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure enables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on the component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example application, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally Stable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be applied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our approach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than their background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications where MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the derivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of pixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an increasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.},

  abstract = {Effective estimation of the salience of environmental stimuli underlies adaptive behavior, while related aberrance is believed to undermine rational thought processes in schizophrenia. A network including bilateral frontoinsular cortex (FIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been observed to respond to salient stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test the hypothesis that activity in this salience network (SN) is less discriminately modulated by contextually-relevant stimuli in schizophrenia than in healthy individuals, fMRI data were collected in 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 13 matched controls during performance of a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task. After quantitatively identifying spatial components representative of the FIC and dACC features of the SN, two principal analyses were conducted. In the first, modulation of SN activity by salience was assessed by measuring response to trial outcome. First-level general linear models were applied to individual-specific time-courses of SN activity identified using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). This analysis revealed a significant salience-by-performance-by-group interaction on the best-fit FIC component's activity at trial outcome, whereby healthy individuals but not individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater distinction between the response to hits and misses in high salience trials than in low salience trials. The second analysis aimed to ascertain whether SN component amplitude differed between the study groups over the duration of the experiment. Independent-samples T-tests on back-projected, percent-signal-change scaled SN component images importantly showed that the groups did not differ in the overall amplitude of SN expression over the entire dataset. These findings of dysregulated but not decreased SN activity in schizophrenia provide physiological support for mechanistic conceptual frameworks of delusional thought formation.},

The technical difficulties in developing truly wearable BCI systems that are capable of making reliable real-time prediction of users' cognitive states in dynamic real-life situations may seem almost insurmountable at times. Fortunately, recent advances in miniature sensors, wireless communication and distributed computing technologies offered promising ways to bridge these chasms. In this paper, we report an attempt to develop a pervasive on-line EEG-BCI system using state-of-art technologies including multi-tier Fog and Cloud Computing, semantic Linked Data search, and adaptive prediction/classification models. To verify our approach, we implement a pilot system by employing wireless dry-electrode EEG headsets and MEMS motion sensors as the front-end devices, Android mobile phones as the personal user interfaces, compact personal computers as the near-end Fog Servers and the computer clusters hosted by the Taiwan National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) as the far-end Cloud Servers. We succeeded in conducting synchronous multi-modal global data streaming in March and then running a multi-player on-line EEG-BCI game in September, 2013. We are currently working with the ARL Translational Neuroscience Branch to use our system in real-life personal stress monitoring and the UCSD Movement Disorder Center to conduct in-home Parkinson's disease patient monitoring experiments. We shall proceed to develop the necessary BCI ontology and introduce automatic semantic annotation and progressive model refinement capability to our system.},

  abstract = {In vivo wide-field imaging of neural activity with a high spatio-temporal resolution is a challenge in modern neuroscience. Although two-photon imaging is very powerful, high-speed imaging of the activity of individual synapses is mostly limited to a field of approximately 200\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m on a side. Wide-field one-photon epifluorescence imaging can reveal neuronal activity over a field of $\geq$1\,mm2 at a high speed, but is not able to resolve a single synapse. Here, to achieve a high spatio-temporal resolution, we combine an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera with spinning-disk one-photon confocal microscopy. This combination allowed us to image a 1 mm2 field with a pixel resolution of 0.21\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m at 60 fps. When we imaged motor cortical layer 1 in a behaving head-restrained mouse, calcium transients were detected in presynaptic boutons of thalamocortical axons sparsely labeled with GCaMP6s, although their density was lower than when two-photon imaging was used. The effects of out-of-focus fluorescence changes on calcium transients in individual boutons appeared minimal. Axonal boutons with highly correlated activity were detected over the 1\,mm2 field, and were probably distributed on multiple axonal arbors originating from the same thalamic neuron. This new microscopy with an 8\,K ultra-high-definition camera should serve to clarify the activity and plasticity of widely distributed cortical synapses.},

For example, when shopping online, a user can easily be overwhelmed by too many choices. To this end, we propose a personalized clothing recommendation system, namely i-Stylist, through the analysis of personal images in social networks. To access the available personal images of a user, the i-Stylist system extracts a number of characteristics from each clothing item such as CNN feature vectors and metadata such as color, material and pattern of the fabric. Then, these clothing items are organized as a fully connected graph to later infer the personalized probability distribution of how the user will like each clothing item in a shopping website. The user is able to modify the graph structure, e.g. adding and deleting vertices by giving feedback about the retrieved clothing items. The i-Stylist system is compared against two other baselines and demonstrated to have better performance.},

  abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of classical feedback control methods to achieve an improved deep brain stimulation (DBS) algorithm for application to Parkinson's disease (PD). Approach. A computational model of PD dynamics was employed to develop model-based rational feedback controller design. The restoration of thalamocortical relay capabilities to patients suffering from PD is formulated as a feedback control problem with the DBS waveform serving as the control input. Two high-level control strategies are tested: one that is driven by an online estimate of thalamic reliability, and another that acts to eliminate substantial decreases in the inhibition from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) to the thalamus. Control laws inspired by traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) methodology are prescribed for each strategy and simulated on this computational model of the basal ganglia network. Main Results. For control based upon thalamic reliability, a strategy of frequency proportional control with proportional bias delivered the optimal control achieved for a given energy expenditure. In comparison, control based upon synaptic inhibitory output from the GPi performed very well in comparison with those of reliability-based control, with considerable further reduction in energy expenditure relative to that of open-loop DBS. The best controller performance was amplitude proportional with derivative control and integral bias, which is full PID control. We demonstrated how optimizing the three components of PID control is feasible in this setting, although the complexity of these optimization functions argues for adaptive methods in implementation. Significance. Our findings point to the potential value of model-based rational design of feedback controllers for Parkinson's disease.},

Here we extend a previous approach based on information theory, the Generalized Transfer Entropy, to the reconstruction of connectivity of simulated neuronal networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show that, due to the model-free nature of the developed measure, both kinds of connections can be reliably inferred if the average firing rate between synchronous burst events exceeds a small minimum frequency. Furthermore, we suggest, based on systematic simulations, that even lower spontaneous inter- burst rates could be raised to meet the requirements of our reconstruction algorithm by applying a weak spatially homogeneous stimulation to the entire network. By combining multiple recordings of the same in silico network before and after pharmacologically blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission, we show then how it becomes possible to infer with high confidence the excitatory or inhibitory nature of each individual neuron.},

Our goal is to compute camera paths that are composed of constant, linear and parabolic segments mimicking the camera motions employed by professional cinematographers. To this end, our algorithm is based on a linear programming framework to minimize the first, second, and third derivatives of the resulting camera path. Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos. Our approach accomplishes this without the need of user interaction or costly 3D reconstruction of the scene, and works as a post-process for videos from any camera or from an online source.},

While event-driven programming can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a state machine programming style which makes many programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We present a novel programming abstraction called protothreads that makes it possible to write eventdriven programs in a thread-like style, with a memory overhead of only two bytes per protothread. We show that protothreads significantly reduce the complexity of a number of widely used programs previously written with event-driven state machines. For the examined programs the majority of the state machines could be entirely removed. In the other cases the number of states and transitions was drastically decreased. With protothreads the number of lines of code was reduced by one third. The execution time overhead of protothreads is on the order of a few processor cycles.},

  abstract = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ``bias''). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

However, without identifying the same neurons across imaging sessions (cell registration), longitudinal analysis of the neural code is restricted to population-level statistics. Accurate cell registration becomes challenging with increased numbers of cells, sessions, and inter-session intervals. Current cell registration practices, whether manual or automatic, do not quantitatively evaluate registration accuracy, possibly leading to data misinterpretation. We developed a probabilistic method that automatically registers cells across multiple sessions and estimates the registration confidence for each registered cell. Using large-scale Ca2+ imaging data recorded over weeks from the hippocampus and cortex of freely behaving mice, we show that our method performs more accurate registration than previously used routines, yielding estimated error rates 5\%, and that the registration is scalable for many sessions. Thus, our method allows reliable longitudinal analysis of the same neurons over long time periods.},

We constructed cost-effective z-scanning modules from off-the-shelf components that can be mounted onto standard multiphoton laser scanning microscopes to extend scan patterns from 2D to 3D. Systems were designed for large objectives and provide high resolution, high speed and a large z-scan range (300 $\mu$m). We used these systems for 3D multiphoton calcium imaging in the adult zebrafish brain and measured odor-evoked activity patterns across 1500 neurons with single-neuron resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio.},

While \{DV\}3D is primarily a visualization tool, the package allows an analysis approach where results from one imaging modality can guide comparative analysis of another modality in a single coordinate space. \{DV\}3D is built on Python, a dynamic object-oriented programming language with support for integration of modular toolkits, and development of cross-platform software for neuroimaging. \{DV\}3D harnesses the power of the Visualization Toolkit (\{VTK\}) for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rendering, calling \{VTK\}'s low level C++ functions from Python. Users interact with data via an intuitive interface that uses Python to bind \{wxWidgets\}, which in turn calls the user's operating system dialogs and graphical user interface tools. \{DV\}3D currently supports \{NIfTI\}-1, \{ANALYZE\} and \{DICOM\} formats for \{MRI\} data display (including statistical data overlay). Formats for other data types are supported. The modularity of \{DV\}3D and ease of use of Python allows rapid integration of additional format support and user development. \{DV\}3D has been tested on Mac \{OSX\}, \{RedHat\} Linux and Microsoft Windows \{XP\}. \{DV\}3D is offered for free download with an extensive set of tutorial resources and example data.},

  abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

  abstract = {Background: The endovascular perforation model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has a large variation in outcomes. This may reflect differences in the SAH size. New method: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 24. h after endovascular perforation in adult male (n= 58) and female (n= 58) rats. Rats were divided into five grades according to MRI characteristics: grade 0: no SAH or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); grade 1: minimal or thin SAH without IVH; grade 2: minimal or thin SAH with IVH; grade 3: thick SAH without IVH; grade 4: thick SAH with IVH. We investigated whether MRI grading scale reflected severity of SAH (determined post mortem) and neurological score. Results: There was a strong correlation between MRI grading scale and current SAH grading scale (P. 0.01) and neurological score (P. 0.01) in male rats. In female rats, there was also a strong correlation between MRI grading scale and SAH grading scale (P. 0.01) but not with neurological score (P= 0.24). Comparison with existing methods: The current grading system is based on the amount of SAH and needs animal euthanasia to evaluate SAH severity. There is no useful grading system to classify severity of SAH without decapitating animals. Conclusions: We demonstrated a correlation between the MRI grading scale and the current SAH grading scale in an endovascular perforation rat model. The MRI grading scale allows evaluation of SAH severity without euthanizing animals.},

Various design candidates created in adaptable design are evaluated by different life-cycle evaluation measures including product adaptability of design, part and assembly costs of manufacturing, and operationability of customers. Since different evaluation measures are modeled in different units, the grey relational analysis method is employed to integrate these measures for prioritizing different design candidates.

  abstract = {This paper presents a flight control and navigation system for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors. The system is designed under the inner loop and outer loop strategy. The trajectory tracking navigation loop is the outer loop of the attitude loop, while the attitude control loop is the outer loop of the stabilization loop. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control was adopted for stabilization and attitude control. The three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking control of a UAV could be approximately divided into lateral control and longitudinal control. The longitudinal control employs traditional linear PID feedback to achieve the desired altitude of the UAV, while the lateral control uses a non-linear control method to complete the desired trajectory. The non-linear controller can automatically adapt to ground velocity change, which is usually caused by gust disturbance, thus the UAV has good wind resistance characteristics. Flight tests and survey missions were carried out with our self-developed delta fixed-wing UAV and MEMS-based autopilot to confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed navigation method. \textcopyright{} 2014 Author(s).},

By varying epitope and scaffold, we generated a diverse family of mutually orthogonal antigens. In cultured neurons and mouse and fly brains, smFP probes allowed robust, orthogonal multicolor visualization of proteins, cell populations and neuropil. smFP variants complement existing tracers and greatly increase the number of simultaneous imaging channels, and they performed well in advanced preparations such as array tomography, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy. In living cells, the probes improved single-molecule image tracking and increased yield for RNA-seq.

  abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue\textendash{}green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of `optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.},

X-ray diffraction analysis also shows that the precursor salts are converted to highly crystalline phases of NiO and YSZ (8mol\% Y2O3) without any intermediate calcination step and no undesirable phases are present. Comparison with the X-ray diffraction pattern of a commercial YSZ sample shows that the process is also effective in maintaining a close compositional control. The microstructure of the sintered and reduced sample shows a well defined network of pores which is necessary for the effective functioning of the anode.

  abstract = {The analysis of texture is an important subroutine in application areas as diverse as biology, medicine, robotics, and forensic science. While the last three decades have seen extensive research in algorithms to measure texture similarity, almost all existing methods require the careful setting of many parameters. There are many problems associated with a lot of parameters, the most obvious of which is that with many parameters to fit, it is very difficult to avoid overfitting. In this work, we propose to extend recent advances in Kolmogorov complexity-based similarity measures to texture matching problems. These Kolmogorov-based methods have been shown to be very useful in intrinsically discrete domains such as DNA, protein sequences, MIDI music, and natural languages; however, they are not well defined for real-valued data. To address this, we introduce a very simple idea, the Campana-Keogh (CK) video compression-based method for texture measures. These measures utilize video compressors to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity. Using the parameter-free CK method, we novely utilize lossy compression to create an efficient and robust parameter-lite texture similarity measure: the CK-1 distance measure. We demonstrate the utility of our measure with extensive empirical evaluations on real-world case studies drawn from nematology, arachnology, entomology, medicine, forensics, texture analysis benchmarks, and many other domains.

It is based on a generalization of the Kuwahara filter that is adapted to the local structure of image features. In this work, two limitations of the anisotropic Kuwahara filter are addressed. First, it is shown that by adding thresholding to the weighting term computation of the sectors, artifacts are avoided and smooth results in noise-corrupted regions are achieved. Second, a multi-scale computation scheme is proposed that simultaneously propagates local orientation estimates and filtering results up a low-pass filtered pyramid. This allows for a strong abstraction effect and avoids artifacts in large low-contrast regions. The propagation is controlled by the local variances and anisotropies that are derived during the computation without extra overhead, resulting in a highly efficient scheme that is particularly suitable for real-time processing on a GPU.},

  abstract = {Interstitial flow is the convective transport of fluid through tissue extracellular matrix. This creeping fluid flow has been shown to affect the morphology and migration of cells such as fibroblasts, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. A microfluidic cell culture system was designed to apply stable pressure gradients and fluid flow and allow direct visualization of transient responses of cells seeded in a 3D collagen type I scaffold. We used this system to examine the effects of interstitial flow on cancer cell morphology and migration and to extend previous studies showing that interstitial flow increases the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-435S melanoma cells [Shields J, et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 11:526\textendash{}538]. Using a breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-231) we also observed cell migration along streamlines in the presence of flow; however, we further demonstrated that the strength of the flow as well as the cell density determined directional bias of migration along the streamline. In particular, we found that cells either at high seeding density or with the CCR-7 receptor inhibited migration against, rather than with the flow. We provide further evidence that CCR7-dependent autologous chemotaxis is the mechanism that leads to migration with the flow, but also demonstrate a competing CCR7-independent mechanism that causes migration against the flow. Data from experiments investigating the effects of cell concentration, interstitial flow rate, receptor activity, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation support our hypothesis that the competing stimulus is integrin mediated. This mechanism may play an important role in development of metastatic disease.},

  abstract = {Existing tools for the preprocessing of EEG data provide a large choice of methods to suitably prepare and analyse a given dataset. Yet it remains a challenge for the average user to integrate methods for batch processing of the increasingly large datasets of modern research, and compare methods to choose an optimal approach across the many possible parameter configurations. Additionally, many tools still require a high degree of manual decision making for, e.g. the classification of artefacts in channels, epochs or segments. This introduces extra subjectivity, is slow, and is not reproducible. Batching and well-designed automation can help to regularise EEG preprocessing, and thus reduce human effort, subjectivity, and consequent error. The Computational Testing for Automated Preprocessing (CTAP) toolbox facilitates: i) batch processing that is easy for experts and novices alike; ii) testing and comparison of preprocessing methods. Here we demonstrate the application of CTAP to high-resolution EEG data in three modes of use. First, a linear processing pipeline with mostly default parameters illustrates ease-of-use for naive users. Second, a branching pipeline illustrates CTAP's support for comparison of competing methods. Third, a pipeline with built-in parameter-sweeping illustrates CTAP's capability to support data-driven method parametrisation. CTAP extends the existing data structure and functions from the well-known EEGLAB toolbox, based on Matlab, and produces extensive quality control outputs. CTAP is available under MIT open-source licence from https://github.com/bwrc/ctap},

  abstract = {Image analysis software is an essential tool used in neuroscience and neural engineering to evaluate changes in neuronal structure following extracellular stimuli. Both manual and automated methods in current use are severely inadequate at detecting and quantifying changes in neuronal morphology when the images analyzed have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This inadequacy derives from the fact that these methods often include data from non-neuronal structures or artifacts by simply tracing pixels with high intensity. In this paper, we describe Neuron Image Analyzer (NIA), a novel algorithm that overcomes these inadequacies by employing Laplacian of Gaussian filter and graphical models (i.e., Hidden Markov Model, Fully Connected Chain Model) to specifically extract relational pixel information corresponding to neuronal structures (i.e., soma, neurite). As such, NIA that is based on vector representation is less likely to detect false signals (i.e., non-neuronal structures) or generate artifact signals (i.e., deformation of original structures) than current image analysis algorithms that are based on raster representation. We demonstrate that NIA enables precise quantification of neuronal processes (e.g., length and orientation of neurites) in low quality images with a significant increase in the accuracy of detecting neuronal changes post-stimulation.},

  abstract = {This protocol and the accompanying software program called LEVER enable quantitative automated analysis of phase contrast time-lapse images of cultured neural stem cells. Images are captured at 5 min. intervals over a period of 5 to 15 days as the cells proliferate and differentiate. LEVER automatically segments, tracks and generates lineage trees of the stem cells from the image sequence. In addition to generating lineage trees capturing the population dynamics of clonal development, LEVER extracts quantitative phenotypic measurements of cell location, shape, movement, and size. When available, the system can include biomolecular markers imaged using fluorescence. It then displays the results to the user for highly efficient inspection and editing to correct any errors in the segmentation, tracking or lineaging. In order to enable high-throughput inspection, LEVER incorporates features for rapid identification of errors, and learning from user-supplied corrections to automatically identify and correct related errors.},

  abstract = {\textemdash{}Anomaly detection plays an important role in pro-tecting computer systems from unforeseen attack by automati-cally recognizing and filter atypical inputs. However, it can be difficult to balance the sensitivity of a detector \textendash{} an aggressive system can filter too many benign inputs while a conservative system can fail to catch anomalies. Accordingly, it is important to rigorously test anomaly detectors to evaluate potential error rates before deployment. However, principled systems for doing so have not been studied \textendash{} testing is typically ad hoc, making it difficult to reproduce results or formally compare detectors. To address this issue we present a technique and implemented system, Fortuna, for obtaining probabilistic bounds on false positive rates for anomaly detectors that process Internet data. Using a probability distribution based on PageRank and an efficient algorithm to draw samples from the distribution, Fortuna computes an estimated false positive rate and a probabilistic bound on the estimate's accuracy. By drawing test samples from a well defined distribution that correlates well with data seen in practice, Fortuna improves on ad hoc methods for estimating false positive rate, giving bounds that are reproducible, comparable across different anomaly detectors, and theoretically sound. Experimental evaluations of three anomaly detectors (SIFT, SOAP, and JSAND) show that Fortuna is efficient enough to use in practice \textemdash{} it can sample enough inputs to obtain tight false positive rate bounds in less than 10 hours for all three detectors. These results indicate that Fortuna can, in practice, help place anomaly detection on a stronger theoretical foundation and help practitioners better understand the behavior and consequences of the anomaly detectors that they deploy. As part of our work, we obtain a theoretical result that may be of independent interest: We give a simple analysis of the convergence rate of the random surfer process defining PageRank that guarantees the same rate as the standard, second-eigenvalue analysis, but does not rely on any assumptions about the link structure of the web.},

Despite the great success of query formulation aids, in particular, automatic query completion, graph query autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this demonstration, we present a novel interactive visual subgraph query autocompletion framework called AUTOG which alleviates the potentially painstaking task of graph query formulation. Specifically, given a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs and a visual query fragment q formulated by a user, AUTOG returns top-k query suggestions Q ‘ as output at interactive time. Users may choose a query from Q ‘ and iteratively apply AUTOG to compose their queries. We demonstrate various features of AUTOG and its superior ability to generate high quality suggestions to aid visual subgraph query formulation.},

High-speed, high resolution imaging can reveal dynamic events such as changes in blood flow and responses to stimulation. Despite these benefits, commercially available scientific cameras rarely include software that is suitable for in-vivo imaging applications, making this highly versatile form of optical imaging challenging and time-consuming to implement. To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences. The complete software suite is available for free download. Here we describe the software's framework and provide details to guide users with development of this and similar software.},

Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) emerged in the late 1960s as a possible therapeutic alternative to lesioning in patients with severe, chronic, intractable pain. DBS devices in the era were based on cardiac pacing technology but were greatly modified in implementation due to the unique needs of DBS. Clinical studies in the 1970s and early 1980s have revealed a technique with modest results which did not lead to regulatory approval for the treatment of pain. In the 1980s a new application for DBS emerged in the treatment of movement disorders. Clinical trials confirmed the robustness of the therapy leading to approvals by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe for the treatment of tremor and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Technology based on that used for earlier clinical research in pain was improved by leveraging advances in cardiac pacing technology resulting in the sophisticated and reliable systems available today. In the 1990s scientific exploration began in the treatment of psychiatric disorders which is ongoing today. Simultaneously, studies into the treatment of epilepsy were begun which resulted in regulatory approval in Europe. Suggestions have been made to expand these scientific explorations to other central nervous system dysfunctions. Opportunity remains to improve the technology including individualized and symptom specific stimulation patterns, more physician and patient friendly programming, and possibly closed-loop systems for more situation dependent and effective therapy.},

  abstract = {While modulating neural activity through stimulation is an effective treatment for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, an opportunity for improving neuromodulation therapy remains in automatically adjusting therapy to continuously optimize patient outcomes. Practical issues associated with achieving this include the paucity of human data related to disease states, poorly validated estimators of patient state, and unknown dynamic mappings of optimal stimulation parameters based on estimated states. To overcome these challenges, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation device to collect data and run automated closed-loop algorithms; an external tool to prototype classifier and control-policy algorithms; and real-time telemetry to update the implanted device firmware and monitor its state. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic large animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find biomarkers of the observed states and transfer functions of different stimulation amplitudes. Data showed that moderate levels of stimulation suppress hippocampal beta activity, while high levels of stimulation produce seizure-like after-discharge activity. The biomarker and transfer function observations were mapped into classifier and control-policy algorithms, which were downloaded to the implanted device to continuously titrate stimulation amplitude for the desired network effect. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {Continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (\{DBS\}) is a widely used therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (\{PD\}) management. However, the mechanisms underlying \{DBS\} effects remain enigmatic and are the subject of an ongoing debate. Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for \{PD\} in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (\{MPTP\}) primate model of \{PD\}. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (\{BG\}) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into \{PD\} pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop \{DBS\} and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop \{DBS\} paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the \{BG\}-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced \{PD\}. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICCPS.2013.6604011},
  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) aim to monitor and control complex real-world phenomena where the computational cost and real-time constraints could be a major challenge. Many- core hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) promise to enhancing computation, leveraging the data parallelism often found in real-world scenarios of CPS, but performance is limited by the overhead of the data trans- fer between the host and the device memory. For example, plasma control in the HBT-EP Tokamak device at Columbia University [11, 18] must execute the control algorithm in a few microseconds, but may take tens of microseconds to copy the data set between the host and the device memory. This paper presents a zero-copy I/O processing scheme that maps the I/O address space of the system to the virtual address space of the compute device, allowing sensors and actuators to transfer data to and from the compute device directly. Experiments using the plasma control system show a 33\% reduction in computational cost, and microbenchmarks with more generic matrix operations show a 34\% reduction, while in both cases, effective data throughput remains at least as good as the current best performers.},

Example applications are pre- sented along with their informational access requirements. An architecture for a gesture storage/retrieval database is presented using a data-warehousing layer model, featuring a real-time interface that enables operation with interac- tive systems. An experimental implementation of this design is presented, OSC Stream DB, that uses a relational schema to store and retrieve bundled OSC messages from a PostgreSQL database backend. Its data access layer is optimized for object-retrieval, time jumps/traversals, meta- data based search and content-based search. A case study is conducted with a high-rate touch-sensing gesture interface. Abenchmark is created for the real-time interface and tested up to the storage of millions of objects. Recommendations for the use of OSC in real-time gesture applications are given based on the concepts and results of this paper.},

Coherence-gated wavefront sensing (CGWS) allows the fast measurement of aberrations in scattering samples and therefore the implementation of adaptive corrections. However, CGWS has been demonstrated so far only in weakly scattering samples. We designed a new CGWS scheme based on a Linnik interferometer and a SLED light source, which is able to compensate dispersion automatically and can be implemented on any microscope. In the highly scattering rat brain tissue, where multiply scattered photons falling within the temporal gate of the CGWS can no longer be neglected, we have measured known defocus and spherical aberrations up to a depth of 400 $\mathrm{\mu}$m.},
