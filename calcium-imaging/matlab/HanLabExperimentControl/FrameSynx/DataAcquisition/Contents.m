%   ExperimentControlGUI - This class creates a GUI that enables basic use
%   of many of the functions available in the FrameSynx toolbox.
%   Unfortunately, use of this GUI is more or less restricted to use with
%   one camera. More flexibility is provided by command-line operations, or
%   through the use of the SystemSynchronizerGUI class.
