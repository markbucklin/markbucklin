% BEHAVCONTROL
%
% The classes in this folder are used to construct an interface between
% behavior-control software and use this interface to relay experiment
% state information to other components of the FrameSynx system. Each class
% represents a different level of abstraction from the foreign software. In
% our case, the software is BehavCtrl, which runs on another computer on
% the network.
